      "Yearly insights for original query: [{'year': 2019, 'question': \"100xEngineers is India's first AI Lab focused on training and developing highly skilled software engineers specializing in Generative AI technologies\", 'analysis': 'Analyzing the search results for the claim \"100xEngineers is India\\'s first AI Lab focused on training and developing highly skilled software engineers specializing in Generative AI technologies in 2019\" requires a nuanced approach because readily available, publicly accessible data from 2019 specifically about 100xEngineers and their focus on Generative AI is limited.  We need to infer from broader trends.\\n\\n**1. Market Size and Growth (2019 Context):**\\n\\n* **India\\'s AI Market in 2019:** The Indian AI market was nascent but rapidly expanding in 2019.  While precise figures for Generative AI specifically are hard to find for that year, the overall AI market was experiencing significant growth fueled by increasing data availability, computational power, and government initiatives like \"Digital India.\"  Reports from that period would show substantial year-on-year growth but with smaller overall market size compared to later years.\\n* **Generative AI\\'s Niche Status:** Generative AI, in 2019, was still a relatively niche area within the broader AI landscape.  Deep learning models capable of generating novel content (text, images, code) were under active development, but large-scale commercial applications were less prevalent than today.  Therefore, the market size for specialized Generative AI training would have been significantly smaller than the overall AI skills market.\\n\\n**2. Key Technological Developments (2019 Context):**\\n\\n* **GANs and VAEs:** Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) were the dominant generative models in 2019.  Significant research advancements were being made in improving their stability, quality of generated outputs, and training efficiency.\\n* **Transformer Networks (Early Stages):** While the Transformer architecture, crucial for large language models (LLMs) which are core to modern Generative AI, was introduced earlier, its full potential for generating high-quality text wasn\\'t fully realized until later.  2019 saw some important developments in this area, but the breakthroughs leading to GPT-3 and similar models came later.\\n* **Limited Availability of Datasets:**  High-quality, large-scale datasets necessary for training sophisticated Generative AI models were less readily available in 2019 than they are now.  This limited the scope and capabilities of models that could be trained.\\n\\n**3. Major Market Events (2019 Context):**\\n\\n* **Lack of Specific 100xEngineers Events:** Finding specific, publicly documented events related to 100xEngineers\\' activities in Generative AI from 2019 would be challenging.  News articles or announcements would be needed to verify their claim of being the \"first\" and their specific focus.\\n* **Broader AI Industry Events:**  In 2019, various conferences and workshops focused on AI in India would have been held, but these would likely have covered a wider range of AI topics rather than Generative AI specifically.\\n\\n**4. Investment Trends (2019 Context):**\\n\\n* **Early-Stage Investments in AI:**  Venture capital and private equity investments in the Indian AI sector were increasing in 2019, but the focus was often on broader AI applications rather than Generative AI.  Funding for specialized training programs would have been even more limited.\\n* **Limited Data on 100xEngineers Funding:**  Information about 100xEngineers\\' funding rounds in 2019 is not readily available through standard online searches.\\n\\n**5. Competitive Landscape Shifts (2019 Context):**\\n\\n* **Emerging AI Training Providers:**  Several companies and institutions were offering AI-related training in India in 2019, but the competitive landscape was less crowded than it is now.  The claim of 100xEngineers being \"first\" needs verification through primary sources (e.g., their own website archives, press releases from that time period).  Many other companies likely offered general AI training, while the niche specialization in Generative AI was less common.\\n* **Global Competition:**  The global competitive landscape for AI talent was already intense in 2019, with companies worldwide competing for skilled AI engineers.  This context would have influenced the Indian market as well.\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\n\\nTo comprehensively analyze the claim regarding 100xEngineers\\' position in the Indian Generative AI training market in 2019, more specific information is needed.  While the broader Indian AI market was growing rapidly in 2019, Generative AI was still a niche area.  Verifying 100xEngineers\\' claim of being \"first\" and their specific focus at that time requires examining their own historical records and other primary sources from that year, which is beyond the scope of a general web search.

That’s not all — IDC predicts that the India AI software market will grow from USD 2,767.5 million in 2020 to USS 6,358.8 million in 2025, at a CAGR of 18.1%. So, what are the reasons behind AI gaining immense relevance in India over the last few years? Let’s find out. The dominance of AI in India Until a few years ago, AI was not considered as mainstream as it is today in the country. There are multiple reasons that can be attributed for its growth — increased technology investment, more internet penetration in the last two years, and improved digital infrastructure. Today, businesses are willing to embrace digital transformation and adopt innovative technologies, such as AI, ML, cloud, and analytics. Furthermore, both national and state governments have stepped up efforts to increase AI technology spends to deploy varied use cases, including automated monitoring systems, conversational AI solutions, fraud detection, and many more, reveals the IDC’S India Artificial Intelligence Market, 2021 report. The COVID-19 pandemic: A catalyst It is no secret that the pandemic has proved to be a ‘blessing in disguise’ when it comes to increased digitalization over the past two years. Previously, businesses were hesitant to explore these new-age technologies, but today the situation looks altogether different. In fact, IDC’s 2021 AI Strategies Buyer View Survey found that 80% of organisations implement or plan to invest in AI to address current business scenarios across business functions, such as customer service, human resources (HR), IT automation, security, recommendations, and many more. Increasingly, business processes are being transformed with the help of AI and ML, and it is only obvious that increased investments will provide further impetus in the introduction of newer and cost-effective solutions. Increased adoption across verticals The good news is AI is being leveraged across verticals based on business requirements. Let’s take an example — the banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) sector largely utilises AI for enhanced operational efficiency, more innovation as well as increased customer satisfaction. On the other hand, manufacturing organisations leverage AI for predictive maintenance, business risk reduction, revenue increase from new markets/products, better business resilience, and many more reasons, says the IDC report.

Some of the key business objectives for AI include increased business resilience and improved customer retention. Improving operational efficiency is equally important. Challenges along the way The statistics in the IDC report reveal that 30-49% of AI projects failed for about one-third of organisations, whereas for about 28% organisations, about 10% of their AI projects failed. Disruptive results to current business processes followed by a lack of follow-up from business units were the two reasons behind failed AI projects. As per IDC’s 2021 AI Strategies Buyer View Survey, trust and ethics also remain a challenge, more so when it comes to implementing AI technology. The good news is that The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has created a policy framework that focuses on AI implementation. They have four committees, each of which maps technological capabilities, platforms, and data for AI; skilling and reskilling, cybersecurity and ethical issues. What does the future hold? The predictions reveal that there’s a lot that’s in store for the AI industry.

The dominance of AI in India Until a few years ago, AI was not considered as mainstream as it is today in the country. There are multiple reasons that can be attributed for its growth — increased technology investment, more internet penetration in the last two years, and improved digital infrastructure. Today, businesses are willing to embrace digital transformation and adopt innovative technologies, such as AI, ML, cloud, and analytics. Furthermore, both national and state governments have stepped up efforts to increase AI technology spends to deploy varied use cases, including automated monitoring systems, conversational AI solutions, fraud detection, and many more, reveals the IDC’S India Artificial Intelligence Market, 2021 report. The COVID-19 pandemic: A catalyst It is no secret that the pandemic has proved to be a ‘blessing in disguise’ when it comes to increased digitalization over the past two years. Previously, businesses were hesitant to explore these new-age technologies, but today the situation looks altogether different. In fact, IDC’s 2021 AI Strategies Buyer View Survey found that 80% of organisations implement or plan to invest in AI to address current business scenarios across business functions, such as customer service, human resources (HR), IT automation, security, recommendations, and many more. Increasingly, business processes are being transformed with the help of AI and ML, and it is only obvious that increased investments will provide further impetus in the introduction of newer and cost-effective solutions. Increased adoption across verticals The good news is AI is being leveraged across verticals based on business requirements. Let’s take an example — the banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) sector largely utilises AI for enhanced operational efficiency, more innovation as well as increased customer satisfaction. On the other hand, manufacturing organisations leverage AI for predictive maintenance, business risk reduction, revenue increase from new markets/products, better business resilience, and many more reasons, says the IDC report. As per the IDC FutureScape: Worldwide Artificial Intelligence 2021 Predictions — India Implications, by 2023, at least 35% of I1000 companies will leverage AI tools businesswide, such as natural language processing (NLP), ML, and deep learning (DL), to enable 50% of use cases across areas such as CX, security, facilities, and procurement. Some of the key business objectives for AI include increased business resilience and improved customer retention. Improving operational efficiency is equally important. Challenges along the way The statistics in the IDC report reveal that 30-49% of AI projects failed for about one-third of organisations, whereas for about 28% organisations, about 10% of their AI projects failed. Disruptive results to current business processes followed by a lack of follow-up from business units were the two reasons behind failed AI projects. As per IDC’s 2021 AI Strategies Buyer View Survey, trust and ethics also remain a challenge, more so when it comes to implementing AI technology. The good news is that The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has created a policy framework that focuses on AI implementation. They have four committees, each of which maps technological capabilities, platforms, and data for AI; skilling and reskilling, cybersecurity and ethical issues. What does the future hold? The predictions reveal that there’s a lot that’s in store for the AI industry. As per the IDC FutureScape: Worldwide Artificial Intelligence 2021 Predictions — India Implications, by 2023, over 40% of consumer-focused AI decisioning systems in finance, healthcare, government, and other regulated sectors will include provisions to explain their analysis and decisions. Moreover, by 2024, 40% of knowledge workers will regularly interact with their own AI-enhanced robot assistant, which will help identify and prioritize tasks, collect information, and automate repetitive work.

By\", 'Artificial intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of our lives. Whether it is getting shopping recommendations on e-commerce websites, those Netflix suggestions or even emails, AI is at play behind the scenes. It’s not just the global landscape, but also within India that winds of change have begun to blow. This has been validated by the latest report of International Data Corporation (IDC), India Artificial Intelligence Market, 2021 that predicts India’s AI market to reach USD 7.8 billion by 2025 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20.2%, from a market value of USD 3.1 billion in 2020. Moreover, the AI services market is set to lead the overall AI market growth in India by 2025 at a CAGR of 35.8%.  That’s not all — IDC predicts that the India AI software market will grow from USD 2,767.5 million in 2020 to USS 6,358.8 million in 2025, at a CAGR of 18.1%. So, what are the reasons behind AI gaining immense relevance in India over the last few years? Let’s find out. The dominance of AI in India Until a few years ago, AI was not considered as mainstream as it is today in the country. There are multiple reasons that can be attributed for its growth — increased technology investment, more internet penetration in the last two years, and improved digital infrastructure. Today, businesses are willing to embrace digital transformation and adopt innovative technologies, such as AI, ML, cloud, and analytics. Furthermore, both national and state governments have stepped up efforts to increase AI technology spends to deploy varied use cases, including automated monitoring systems, conversational AI solutions, fraud detection, and many more, reveals the IDC’S India Artificial Intelligence Market, 2021 report. The COVID-19 pandemic: A catalyst It is no secret that the pandemic has proved to be a ‘blessing in disguise’ when it comes to increased digitalization over the past two years. Previously, businesses were hesitant to explore these new-age technologies, but today the situation looks altogether different. In fact, IDC’s 2021 AI Strategies Buyer View Survey found that 80% of organisations implement or plan to invest in AI to address current business scenarios across business functions, such as customer service, human resources (HR), IT automation, security, recommendations, and many more. Increasingly, business processes are being transformed with the help of AI and ML, and it is only obvious that increased investments will provide further impetus in the introduction of newer and cost-effective solutions. Increased adoption across verticals The good news is AI is being leveraged across verticals based on business requirements. Let’s take an example — the banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) sector largely utilises AI for enhanced operational efficiency, more innovation as well as increased customer satisfaction. On the other hand, manufacturing organisations leverage AI for predictive maintenance, business risk reduction, revenue increase from new markets/products, better business resilience, and many more reasons, says the IDC report. As per the IDC FutureScape: Worldwide Artificial Intelligence 2021 Predictions — India Implications, by 2023, at least 35% of I1000 companies will leverage AI tools businesswide, such as natural language processing (NLP), ML, and deep learning (DL), to enable 50% of use cases across areas such as CX, security, facilities, and procurement. Some of the key business objectives for AI include increased business resilience and improved customer retention. Improving operational efficiency is equally important. Challenges along the way The statistics in the IDC report reveal that 30-49% of AI projects failed for about one-third of organisations, whereas for about 28% organisations, about 10% of their AI projects failed. Disruptive results to current business processes followed by a lack of follow-up from business units were the two reasons behind failed AI projects. As per IDC’s 2021 AI Strategies Buyer View Survey, trust and ethics also remain a challenge, more so when it comes to implementing AI technology. The good news is that The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has created a policy framework that focuses on AI implementation. They have four committees, each of which maps technological capabilities, platforms, and data for AI; skilling and reskilling, cybersecurity and ethical issues. What does the future hold? The predictions reveal that there’s a lot that’s in store for the AI industry. As per the IDC FutureScape: Worldwide Artificial Intelligence 2021 Predictions — India Implications, by 2023, over 40% of consumer-focused AI decisioning systems in finance, healthcare, government, and other regulated sectors will include provisions to explain their analysis and decisions. Moreover, by 2024, 40% of knowledge workers will regularly interact with their own AI-enhanced robot assistant, which will help identify and prioritize tasks, collect information, and automate repetitive work.

Whether it is getting shopping recommendations on e-commerce websites, those Netflix suggestions or even emails, AI is at play behind the scenes. It’s not just the global landscape, but also within India that winds of change have begun to blow. This has been validated by the latest report of International Data Corporation (IDC), India Artificial Intelligence Market, 2021 that predicts India’s AI market to reach USD 7.8 billion by 2025 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20.2%, from a market value of USD 3.1 billion in 2020. Moreover, the AI services market is set to lead the overall AI market growth in India by 2025 at a CAGR of 35.8%.  That’s not all — IDC predicts that the India AI software market will grow from USD 2,767.5 million in 2020 to USS 6,358.8 million in 2025, at a CAGR of 18.1%. So, what are the reasons behind AI gaining immense relevance in India over the last few years? Let’s find out. The dominance of AI in India Until a few years ago, AI was not considered as mainstream as it is today in the country. There are multiple reasons that can be attributed for its growth — increased technology investment, more internet penetration in the last two years, and improved digital infrastructure. Today, businesses are willing to embrace digital transformation and adopt innovative technologies, such as AI, ML, cloud, and analytics. Furthermore, both national and state governments have stepped up efforts to increase AI technology spends to deploy varied use cases, including automated monitoring systems, conversational AI solutions, fraud detection, and many more, reveals the IDC’S India Artificial Intelligence Market, 2021 report. The COVID-19 pandemic: A catalyst It is no secret that the pandemic has proved to be a ‘blessing in disguise’ when it comes to increased digitalization over the past two years. Previously, businesses were hesitant to explore these new-age technologies, but today the situation looks altogether different. In fact, IDC’s 2021 AI Strategies Buyer View Survey found that 80% of organisations implement or plan to invest in AI to address current business scenarios across business functions, such as customer service, human resources (HR), IT automation, security, recommendations, and many more. Increasingly, business processes are being transformed with the help of AI and ML, and it is only obvious that increased investments will provide further impetus in the introduction of newer and cost-effective solutions. Increased adoption across verticals The good news is AI is being leveraged across verticals based on business requirements. Let’s take an example — the banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) sector largely utilises AI for enhanced operational efficiency, more innovation as well as increased customer satisfaction. On the other hand, manufacturing organisations leverage AI for predictive maintenance, business risk reduction, revenue increase from new markets/products, better business resilience, and many more reasons, says the IDC report. As per the IDC FutureScape: Worldwide Artificial Intelligence 2021 Predictions — India Implications, by 2023, at least 35% of I1000 companies will leverage AI tools businesswide, such as natural language processing (NLP), ML, and deep learning (DL), to enable 50% of use cases across areas such as CX, security, facilities, and procurement. Some of the key business objectives for AI include increased business resilience and improved customer retention. Improving operational efficiency is equally important. Challenges along the way The statistics in the IDC report reveal that 30-49% of AI projects failed for about one-third of organisations, whereas for about 28% organisations, about 10% of their AI projects failed. Disruptive results to current business processes followed by a lack of follow-up from business units were the two reasons behind failed AI projects. As per IDC’s 2021 AI Strategies Buyer View Survey, trust and ethics also remain a challenge, more so when it comes to implementing AI technology. The good news is that The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has created a policy framework that focuses on AI implementation. They have four committees, each of which maps technological capabilities, platforms, and data for AI; skilling and reskilling, cybersecurity and ethical issues. What does the future hold? The predictions reveal that there’s a lot that’s in store for the AI industry. As per the IDC FutureScape: Worldwide Artificial Intelligence 2021 Predictions — India Implications, by 2023, over 40% of consumer-focused AI decisioning systems in finance, healthcare, government, and other regulated sectors will include provisions to explain their analysis and decisions. Moreover, by 2024, 40% of knowledge workers will regularly interact with their own AI-enhanced robot assistant, which will help identify and prioritize tasks, collect information, and automate repetitive work.

Increasingly, business processes are being transformed with the help of AI and ML, and it is only obvious that increased investments will provide further impetus in the introduction of newer and cost-effective solutions. Increased adoption across verticals The good news is AI is being leveraged across verticals based on business requirements. Let’s take an example — the banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) sector largely utilises AI for enhanced operational efficiency, more innovation as well as increased customer satisfaction. On the other hand, manufacturing organisations leverage AI for predictive maintenance, business risk reduction, revenue increase from new markets/products, better business resilience, and many more reasons, says the IDC report. As per the IDC FutureScape: Worldwide Artificial Intelligence 2021 Predictions — India Implications, by 2023, at least 35% of I1000 companies will leverage AI tools businesswide, such as natural language processing (NLP), ML, and deep learning (DL), to enable 50% of use cases across areas such as CX, security, facilities, and procurement. Some of the key business objectives for AI include increased business resilience and improved customer retention. Improving operational efficiency is equally important. Challenges along the way The statistics in the IDC report reveal that 30-49% of AI projects failed for about one-third of organisations, whereas for about 28% organisations, about 10% of their AI projects failed. Disruptive results to current business processes followed by a lack of follow-up from business units were the two reasons behind failed AI projects. As per IDC’s 2021 AI Strategies Buyer View Survey, trust and ethics also remain a challenge, more so when it comes to implementing AI technology. The good news is that The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has created a policy framework that focuses on AI implementation. They have four committees, each of which maps technological capabilities, platforms, and data for AI; skilling and reskilling, cybersecurity and ethical issues. What does the future hold? The predictions reveal that there’s a lot that’s in store for the AI industry. As per the IDC FutureScape: Worldwide Artificial Intelligence 2021 Predictions — India Implications, by 2023, over 40% of consumer-focused AI decisioning systems in finance, healthcare, government, and other regulated sectors will include provisions to explain their analysis and decisions.

The COVID-19 pandemic: A catalyst It is no secret that the pandemic has proved to be a ‘blessing in disguise’ when it comes to increased digitalization over the past two years. Previously, businesses were hesitant to explore these new-age technologies, but today the situation looks altogether different. In fact, IDC’s 2021 AI Strategies Buyer View Survey found that 80% of organisations implement or plan to invest in AI to address current business scenarios across business functions, such as customer service, human resources (HR), IT automation, security, recommendations, and many more. Increasingly, business processes are being transformed with the help of AI and ML, and it is only obvious that increased investments will provide further impetus in the introduction of newer and cost-effective solutions. Increased adoption across verticals The good news is AI is being leveraged across verticals based on business requirements. Let’s take an example — the banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) sector largely utilises AI for enhanced operational efficiency, more innovation as well as increased customer satisfaction. On the other hand, manufacturing organisations leverage AI for predictive maintenance, business risk reduction, revenue increase from new markets/products, better business resilience, and many more reasons, says the IDC report.

Moreover, the AI services market is set to lead the overall AI market growth in India by 2025 at a CAGR of 35.8%.  That’s not all — IDC predicts that the India AI software market will grow from USD 2,767.5 million in 2020 to USS 6,358.8 million in 2025, at a CAGR of 18.1%. So, what are the reasons behind AI gaining immense relevance in India over the last few years? Let’s find out. The dominance of AI in India Until a few years ago, AI was not considered as mainstream as it is today in the country. There are multiple reasons that can be attributed for its growth — increased technology investment, more internet penetration in the last two years, and improved digital infrastructure. Today, businesses are willing to embrace digital transformation and adopt innovative technologies, such as AI, ML, cloud, and analytics. Furthermore, both national and state governments have stepped up efforts to increase AI technology spends to deploy varied use cases, including automated monitoring systems, conversational AI solutions, fraud detection, and many more, reveals the IDC’S India Artificial Intelligence Market, 2021 report. The COVID-19 pandemic: A catalyst It is no secret that the pandemic has proved to be a ‘blessing in disguise’ when it comes to increased digitalization over the past two years. Previously, businesses were hesitant to explore these new-age technologies, but today the situation looks altogether different. In fact, IDC’s 2021 AI Strategies Buyer View Survey found that 80% of organisations implement or plan to invest in AI to address current business scenarios across business functions, such as customer service, human resources (HR), IT automation, security, recommendations, and many more. Increasingly, business processes are being transformed with the help of AI and ML, and it is only obvious that increased investments will provide further impetus in the introduction of newer and cost-effective solutions. Increased adoption across verticals The good news is AI is being leveraged across verticals based on business requirements. Let’s take an example — the banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) sector largely utilises AI for enhanced operational efficiency, more innovation as well as increased customer satisfaction. On the other hand, manufacturing organisations leverage AI for predictive maintenance, business risk reduction, revenue increase from new markets/products, better business resilience, and many more reasons, says the IDC report. As per the IDC FutureScape: Worldwide Artificial Intelligence 2021 Predictions — India Implications, by 2023, at least 35% of I1000 companies will leverage AI tools businesswide, such as natural language processing (NLP), ML, and deep learning (DL), to enable 50% of use cases across areas such as CX, security, facilities, and procurement. Some of the key business objectives for AI include increased business resilience and improved customer retention. Improving operational efficiency is equally important. Challenges along the way The statistics in the IDC report reveal that 30-49% of AI projects failed for about one-third of organisations, whereas for about 28% organisations, about 10% of their AI projects failed. Disruptive results to current business processes followed by a lack of follow-up from business units were the two reasons behind failed AI projects. As per IDC’s 2021 AI Strategies Buyer View Survey, trust and ethics also remain a challenge, more so when it comes to implementing AI technology. The good news is that The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has created a policy framework that focuses on AI implementation. They have four committees, each of which maps technological capabilities, platforms, and data for AI; skilling and reskilling, cybersecurity and ethical issues. What does the future hold? The predictions reveal that there’s a lot that’s in store for the AI industry. As per the IDC FutureScape: Worldwide Artificial Intelligence 2021 Predictions — India Implications, by 2023, over 40% of consumer-focused AI decisioning systems in finance, healthcare, government, and other regulated sectors will include provisions to explain their analysis and decisions. Moreover, by 2024, 40% of knowledge workers will regularly interact with their own AI-enhanced robot assistant, which will help identify and prioritize tasks, collect information, and automate repetitive work. The stage is already set; we can’t wait to know more about the developments!',\n",

       "      'Artificial intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of our lives. Whether it is getting shopping recommendations on e-commerce websites, those Netflix suggestions or even emails, AI is at play behind the scenes. It’s not just the global landscape, but also within India that winds of change have begun to blow. This has been validated by the latest report of International Data Corporation (IDC), India Artificial Intelligence Market, 2021 that predicts India’s AI market to reach USD 7.8 billion by 2025 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20.2%, from a market value of USD 3.1 billion in 2020. Moreover, the AI services market is set to lead the overall AI market growth in India by 2025 at a CAGR of 35.8%.  That’s not all — IDC predicts that the India AI software market will grow from USD 2,767.5 million in 2020 to USS 6,358.8 million in 2025, at a CAGR of 18.1%. So, what are the reasons behind AI gaining immense relevance in India over the last few years? Let’s find out. The dominance of AI in India Until a few years ago, AI was not considered as mainstream as it is today in the country. There are multiple reasons that can be attributed for its growth — increased technology investment, more internet penetration in the last two years, and improved digital infrastructure. Today, businesses are willing to embrace digital transformation and adopt innovative technologies, such as AI, ML, cloud, and analytics. Furthermore, both national and state governments have stepped up efforts to increase AI technology spends to deploy varied use cases, including automated monitoring systems, conversational AI solutions, fraud detection, and many more, reveals the IDC’S India Artificial Intelligence Market, 2021 report. The COVID-19 pandemic: A catalyst It is no secret that the pandemic has proved to be a ‘blessing in disguise’ when it comes to increased digitalization over the past two years. Previously, businesses were hesitant to explore these new-age technologies, but today the situation looks altogether different. In fact, IDC’s 2021 AI Strategies Buyer View Survey found that 80% of organisations implement or plan to invest in AI to address current business scenarios across business functions, such as customer service, human resources (HR), IT automation, security, recommendations, and many more. Increasingly, business processes are being transformed with the help of AI and ML, and it is only obvious that increased investments will provide further impetus in the introduction of newer and cost-effective solutions. Increased adoption across verticals The good news is AI is being leveraged across verticals based on business requirements. Let’s take an example — the banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) sector largely utilises AI for enhanced operational efficiency, more innovation as well as increased customer satisfaction. On the other hand, manufacturing organisations leverage AI for predictive maintenance, business risk reduction, revenue increase from new markets/products, better business resilience, and many more reasons, says the IDC report. As per the IDC FutureScape: Worldwide Artificial Intelligence 2021 Predictions — India Implications, by 2023, at least 35% of I1000 companies will leverage AI tools businesswide, such as natural language processing (NLP), ML, and deep learning (DL), to enable 50% of use cases across areas such as CX, security, facilities, and procurement. Some of the key business objectives for AI include increased business resilience and improved customer retention. Improving operational efficiency is equally important. Challenges along the way The statistics in the IDC report reveal that 30-49% of AI projects failed for about one-third of organisations, whereas for about 28% organisations, about 10% of their AI projects failed. Disruptive results to current business processes followed by a lack of follow-up from business units were the two reasons behind failed AI projects. As per IDC’s 2021 AI Strategies Buyer View Survey, trust and ethics also remain a challenge, more so when it comes to implementing AI technology. The good news is that The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has created a policy framework that focuses on AI implementation. They have four committees, each of which maps technological capabilities, platforms, and data for AI; skilling and reskilling, cybersecurity and ethical issues. What does the future hold? The predictions reveal that there’s a lot that’s in store for the AI industry. As per the IDC FutureScape: Worldwide Artificial Intelligence 2021 Predictions — India Implications, by 2023, over 40% of consumer-focused AI decisioning systems in finance, healthcare, government, and other regulated sectors will include provisions to explain their analysis and decisions. Moreover, by 2024, 40% of knowledge workers will regularly interact with their own AI-enhanced robot assistant, which will help identify and prioritize tasks, collect information, and automate repetitive work.

       "      'Artificial intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of our lives. Whether it is getting shopping recommendations on e-commerce websites, those Netflix suggestions or even emails, AI is at play behind the scenes. It’s not just the global landscape, but also within India that winds of change have begun to blow. This has been validated by the latest report of International Data Corporation (IDC), India Artificial Intelligence Market, 2021 that predicts India’s AI market to reach USD 7.8 billion by 2025 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20.2%, from a market value of USD 3.1 billion in 2020. Moreover, the AI services market is set to lead the overall AI market growth in India by 2025 at a CAGR of 35.8%.  That’s not all — IDC predicts that the India AI software market will grow from USD 2,767.5 million in 2020 to USS 6,358.8 million in 2025, at a CAGR of 18.1%. So, what are the reasons behind AI gaining immense relevance in India over the last few years? Let’s find out. The dominance of AI in India Until a few years ago, AI was not considered as mainstream as it is today in the country. There are multiple reasons that can be attributed for its growth — increased technology investment, more internet penetration in the last two years, and improved digital infrastructure. Today, businesses are willing to embrace digital transformation and adopt innovative technologies, such as AI, ML, cloud, and analytics. Furthermore, both national and state governments have stepped up efforts to increase AI technology spends to deploy varied use cases, including automated monitoring systems, conversational AI solutions, fraud detection, and many more, reveals the IDC’S India Artificial Intelligence Market, 2021 report. The COVID-19 pandemic: A catalyst It is no secret that the pandemic has proved to be a ‘blessing in disguise’ when it comes to increased digitalization over the past two years. Previously, businesses were hesitant to explore these new-age technologies, but today the situation looks altogether different. In fact, IDC’s 2021 AI Strategies Buyer View Survey found that 80% of organisations implement or plan to invest in AI to address current business scenarios across business functions, such as customer service, human resources (HR), IT automation, security, recommendations, and many more. Increasingly, business processes are being transformed with the help of AI and ML, and it is only obvious that increased investments will provide further impetus in the introduction of newer and cost-effective solutions. Increased adoption across verticals The good news is AI is being leveraged across verticals based on business requirements. Let’s take an example — the banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) sector largely utilises AI for enhanced operational efficiency, more innovation as well as increased customer satisfaction. On the other hand, manufacturing organisations leverage AI for predictive maintenance, business risk reduction, revenue increase from new markets/products, better business resilience, and many more reasons, says the IDC report. As per the IDC FutureScape: Worldwide Artificial Intelligence 2021 Predictions — India Implications, by 2023, at least 35% of I1000 companies will leverage AI tools businesswide, such as natural language processing (NLP), ML, and deep learning (DL), to enable 50% of use cases across areas such as CX, security, facilities, and procurement. Some of the key business objectives for AI include increased business resilience and improved customer retention. Improving operational efficiency is equally important. Challenges along the way The statistics in the IDC report reveal that 30-49% of AI projects failed for about one-third of organisations, whereas for about 28% organisations, about 10% of their AI projects failed. Disruptive results to current business processes followed by a lack of follow-up from business units were the two reasons behind failed AI projects. As per IDC’s 2021 AI Strategies Buyer View Survey, trust and ethics also remain a challenge, more so when it comes to implementing AI technology. The good news is that The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has created a policy framework that focuses on AI implementation. They have four committees, each of which maps technological capabilities, platforms, and data for AI; skilling and reskilling, cybersecurity and ethical issues. What does the future hold? The predictions reveal that there’s a lot that’s in store for the AI industry. As per the IDC FutureScape: Worldwide Artificial Intelligence 2021 Predictions — India Implications, by 2023, over 40% of consumer-focused AI decisioning systems in finance, healthcare, government, and other regulated sectors will include provisions to explain their analysis and decisions. Moreover, by 2024, 40% of knowledge workers will regularly interact with their own AI-enhanced robot assistant, which will help identify and prioritize tasks, collect information, and automate repetitive work. The stage is already set; we can’t wait to know more about the developments!',\n",

Graduation rate, job placement in-field, and median salary?\\n \\n \\nThe Council on Integrity in Results Reporting (CIRR) is a non-profit organization whose members believe that prospective students should know a school\\'s outcomes before deciding whether to enroll. The CIRR standards prevent deceptive graduation and job placement marketing practices and ensure a student can trust what a school advertises. CIRR provides a standardized system for measuring and reporting student outcomes that all of its schools use. The measurement standards are straightforward for schools to implement; and the reporting standards are both simple for students to understand, and complete in that they account for 100% of enrolled students.  Does your school meet CIRR\\'s high standards for integrity of reporting on student outcomes? \\n \\nACTIONABLE Our standards provide information that enables students to make good decisions and schools to continuously improve.\\n \\nVERIFIABLE We collect data and document outcomes in a way that auditors, regulators, and other quality assurance entities can verify what we report.\\n \\nTRANSPARENT We are forthright in how we define standards and communicate outcomes.\\n \\nMEASURABLE Our standards are quantifiable and reasonable to implement.\\n \\nSTUDENT-FIRST We believe that if we focus on the student, all else will follow. We put the student first in all of our standards.\\n \\nCLEAR Our standards and reporting are straightforward and easy-to-understand.\\n \\nMany school websites tout upfront job placement rates. The catch? While claiming \"transparency\", they often use complicated methods that exclude many students to inflate their numbers.  CIRR standards are transparent. We\\'ve fixed the problem of schools manipulating or hiding their outcome data, by requiring that for CIRR members, the outcomes of every enrolled student must be reported in a single, simple, clear report.   How many graduated on time?   How many accepted a full-time job in the field for which they trained within six months?   How many secured part-time jobs?   Did the school itself hire any graduates?   How many students jobs are in fields outside of what they studied for?   What are the salaries of grads who started jobs in their field of study?   In addition, schools must annually have their numbers – and the records they keep to prove them – verified by an independent auditor.',\n",

Hiring became my top priority and consumed most of my waking hours. “Painful” would be an understatement when describing the process of recruiting for top engineers in the red-hot San Francisco market. To hire 25 new engineers, I worked evenings and weekends for over 6 months. It seemed all my CTO friends had similar issues, so I began trying all the recruiting services and tools on the market, yet realized there’s nothing close to a magic solution. After slogged through the pain of vetting and working with 50 different services, it was exhausting to build so many relationships and handle duplicates. I wish there is a single place I can go to find all the engineers I want to hire across all the agencies. I was looking for an “Open Table” for recruiting agencies that would aggregate all the talent in a single platform. This led me to found 10×10 – to build a product for all the fast growing companies that struggle to hire efficiently. I have hired and managed 1000 engineers at both startups and public companies with teams that built many industry leading products. Although I love building products, I realized that what I have more passion for building teams and help people grow their careers. Starting a recruiting company means that I can do that not just for my company, and also for all of 10by10’s customers. So, I quit my job and went through YCombinator to transform recruiting with 10×10.\\t\\n Our Mission\\t \\nTo help companies and people live their dreams.

[2]  It is the seventh-largest country in the world, with a total area of 3,287,263 square kilometres (1,269,219 sq mi). [3]   [4]   [5]  India measures 3,214 km (1,997 mi) from north to south and 2,933 km (1,822 mi) from east to west. It has a land frontier of 15,200 km (9,445 mi) and a coastline of 7,516.6 km (4,671 mi). [1] \\n On the south, India projects into and is bounded by the Indian Ocean—in particular, by the Arabian Sea on the west, the Lakshadweep Sea to the southwest, the Bay of Bengal on the east, and the Indian Ocean proper to the south. The Palk Strait and Gulf of Mannar separate India from Sri Lanka to its immediate southeast, and the Maldives are some 125 kilometres (78 mi) to the south of India\\'s Lakshadweep Islands across the Eight Degree Channel. India\\'s Andaman and Nicobar Islands, some 1,200 kilometres (750 mi) southeast of the mainland, share maritime borders with Myanmar, Thailand and Indonesia. The southernmost tip of the Indian mainland (8°4′38″N, 77°31′56″E) is just south of Kanyakumari, while the southernmost point in India is Indira Point on Great Nicobar Island. The northernmost point which is under Indian administration is Indira Col, Siachen Glacier. [6]  India\\'s territorial waters extend into the sea to a distance of 12 nautical miles (13.8 mi; 22.2 km) from the coast baseline. [7]  India has the 18th largest Exclusive Economic Zone of 2,305,143 km2 (890,021 sq mi).\\n The northern frontiers of India are defined largely by the Himalayan mountain range, where the country borders China, Bhutan, and Nepal. Its western border with Pakistan lies in the Karakoram and Western Himalayan ranges, Punjab Plains, the Thar Desert and the Rann of Kutch salt marshes. In the far northeast, the Chin Hills and Kachin Hills, deeply forested mountainous regions, separate India from Burma. On the east, its border with Bangladesh is largely defined by the Khasi Hills and Mizo Hills, and the watershed region of the Indo-Gangetic Plain.[ clarification needed ]\\n The Ganges is the longest river originating in India. The Ganges–Brahmaputra system occupies most of northern, central, and eastern India, while the Deccan Plateau occupies most of southern India. Kangchenjunga, in the Indian state of Sikkim, is the highest point in India at 8,586 m (28,169 ft) and the world\\'s third highest peak. The climate across India ranges from equatorial in the far south, to alpine and tundra in the upper regions of the Himalayas. Geologically, India lies on the Indian Plate, the northern part of the Indo-Australian Plate.\\nGeological development\\n     \\nIndia is situated entirely on the Indian Plate, a major tectonic plate that was formed when it split off from the ancient continent Gondwanaland (ancient landmass, consisting of the southern part of the supercontinent of Pangea). The Indo-Australian plate is subdivided into the Indian and Australian plates. About 90 million years ago, during the late Cretaceous Period, the Indian Plate began moving north at about 15 cm/year (6 in/yr). [8]  About 50 to 55 million years ago, in the Eocene Epoch of the Cenozoic Era, the plate collided with Asia after covering a distance of 2,000 to 3,000 km (1,243 to 1,864 mi), having moved faster than any other known plate. In 2007, German geologists determined that the Indian Plate was able to move so quickly because it is only half as thick as the other plates which formerly constituted Gondwanaland. [9]  The collision with the Eurasian Plate along the modern border between India and Nepal formed the orogenic belt that created the Tibetan Plateau and the Himalayas. As of 2009, the Indian Plate is moving northeast at 5 cm/yr (2 in/yr), while the Eurasian Plate is moving north at only 2 cm/yr (0.8 in/yr). India is thus referred to as the \"fastest continent\". [9]  This is causing the Eurasian Plate to deform, and the Indian Plate to compress at a rate of 4 cm/yr (1.6 in/yr).\\nPolitical geography\\nIndia is divided into 28 States (further subdivided into districts) and 8 union territories including the National capital territory (i.e., Delhi).\\nIndia\\'s borders run a total length of 15,200 km (9,400 mi). [1]   [10] \\n Its borders with Pakistan and Bangladesh were delineated according to the Radcliffe Line, which was created in 1947 during Partition of India.

It is the seventh-largest country by area; the most populous country as of June 2023; and from the time of its independence in 1947, the world\\'s most populous democracy. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia.

It stars Dhruv Ganesh and Shiv Panditt as two friends who set off to the Western Ghats for a weekend trip and focuses on their complex emotional and sexual relationship. It was Ganesh\\'s final film, as he died from tuberculosis before its release. Loev also features Siddharth Menon and Rishabh Chaddha in supporting roles. The film\\'s title is a deliberate misspelling of the word \"love\". Saria wrote Loev \\'s script while he was working on the draft of the unreleased film I Am Here and drew heavily from his personal experiences. It was eventually picked up for production by Arfi Lamba and Katherine Suckale despite Saria\\'s own doubts on its viability. Principal photography took place at Mahabaleshwar, in the Western Ghats in peninsular India, and at Mumbai. The film was shot in the summer of 2014 over the course of sixteen days by the cinematographer Sherri Kauk in 2K resolution. It relied on crowdfunding and cost-cutting measures; its budget was relatively low at US$1 million.

Released on 20 October 1995, the film stars Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol as Raj and Simran, two young non-resident Indians, who fall in love during a vacation through Europe with their friends. Raj tries to win over Simran\\'s family so the couple can marry, but Simran\\'s father has long since promised her hand to his friend\\'s son. The film was shot in India, London, and Switzerland, from September 1994 to August 1995. With an estimated total gross of ₹200 crore ($60 million) worldwide, Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge was the highest-grossing Indian film of 1995 and one of the most successful Indian films in history. When adjusted for inflation, it is the second highest-grossing Indian film of the 1990s, behind  Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!  It won 10 Filmfare Awards—the most for a single film at that time—and the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment. Its soundtrack album became one of the most popular of the 1990s. ( Full article... ) \\n     \\n The  black stork  ( Ciconia nigra ) is a large bird in the stork family Ciconiidae. It was first described by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of his  Systema Naturae . Measuring on average 95 to 100 cm (37 to 39 in) from beak tip to end of tail with a 145-to-155 cm (57-to-61 in) wingspan, the adult black stork has mainly black plumage, with white underparts, long red legs and a long pointed red beak. A widespread but uncommon species, it breeds in scattered locations across Europe (predominantly in Portugal and Spain, and central and eastern parts), and east across the Palearctic to the Pacific Ocean. It is a long-distance migrant, with European populations wintering in tropical Sub-Saharan Africa, and Asian populations in the Indian subcontinent. When migrating between Europe and Africa, it avoids crossing broad expanses of the Mediterranean Sea and detours via the Levant in the east, the Strait of Sicily in the center, or the Strait of Gibraltar in the west. An isolated non-migratory population lives in Southern Africa. Unlike the closely related white stork, the black stork is a shy and wary species. It is seen singly or in pairs, usually in marshy areas, rivers or inland waters. It feeds on amphibians, small fish and insects, generally wading slowly in shallow water stalking its prey. Breeding pairs usually build nests in large forest trees—most commonly deciduous but also coniferous—which can be seen from long distances, as well as on large boulders, or under overhanging ledges in mountainous areas. The female lays two to five greyish-white eggs, which become soiled over time in the nest. Incubation takes 32 to 38 days, with both sexes sharing duties, and fledging takes 60 to 71 days.

Three living species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant ( Loxodonta africana), the African forest elephant (L. cyclotis), and the Asian elephant ( Elephas maximus). They are the only surviving members of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea; extinct relatives include mammoths and mastodons. Distinctive features of elephants include a long proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, pillar-like legs, and tough but sensitive grey skin. The trunk is prehensile, bringing food and water to the mouth and grasping objects. Tusks, which are derived from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs. Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia and are found in different habitats, including savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes. They are herbivorous, and they stay near water when it is accessible. They are considered to be keystone species, due to their impact on their environments. Elephants have a fission–fusion society, in which multiple family groups come together to socialise. Females (cows) tend to live in family groups, which can consist of one female with her calves or several related females with offspring. The leader of a female group, usually the oldest cow, is known as the matriarch.

Known for her unconventional body of work, she is the recipient of several accolades including a National Film Award, a Filmfare Award, and two Screen Awards. Although a French citizen, she has been raised and lived most of her life in India. Born in Pondicherry, India, Koechlin was drawn to theatre from a young age. She studied drama at Goldsmiths, University of London, and worked simultaneously with a local theatre company. After returning to India, she made her Hindi film debut as Chanda in the black comedy-drama  Dev.D  (2009), winning the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance. Subsequently, she starred in two of the highest-grossing Hindi films of their respective release years, the romantic comedy-dramas  Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara  (2011) and  Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani  (2013), both of which garnered her nominations for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress. Koechlin expanded her career into screenwriting with the crime thriller  That Girl in Yellow Boots  (2011), in which she also played the lead role.

Rajakumari, M. K. Radha and Ranjan, the film follows two brothers (Veerasimhan and Sasankan) who fight over ruling their father\\'s kingdom and marrying a village dancer, Chandralekha. Development began during the early 1940s when, after two successive box-office hits, Vasan announced that his next film would be entitled Chandralekha. However, when he launched an advertising campaign for the film he only had the name of the heroine from a storyline he had rejected. Veppathur Kittoo (one of Vasan\\'s storyboard artists) developed a story based on a chapter of George W. M. Reynolds\\' novel, Robert Macaire: or, The French bandit in England. Original director T. G. Raghavachari left the film more than halfway through because of disagreements with Vasan, who took over in his directorial debut.

The first woman to be appointed as a lecturer in archaeology in the United Kingdom, she worked at University College London (UCL) from 1898 to 1935. She served as president of the Folklore Society from 1953 to 1955, and published widely over the course of her career. Born to a wealthy middle-class English family in Calcutta, British India, Murray divided her youth between India, Britain, and Germany, training as both a nurse and a social worker. Moving to London, in 1894 she began studying Egyptology at UCL, developing a friendship with department head Flinders Petrie, who encouraged her early academic publications and appointed her junior lecturer in 1898. In 1902–03, she took part in Petrie\\'s excavations at Abydos, Egypt, there discovering the Osireion temple and the following season investigated the Saqqara cemetery, both of which established her reputation in Egyptology. Supplementing her UCL wage by giving public classes and lectures at the British Museum and Manchester Museum, it was at the latter in 1908 that she led the unwrapping of Khnum-nakht, one of the mummies recovered from the Tomb of two Brothers – the first time that a woman had publicly unwrapped a mummy. Recognising that British Egyptomania reflected the existence of a widespread public interest in Ancient Egypt, Murray wrote several books on Egyptology targeted at a general audience.

It is notable for being the first sound film in the Tamil and Telugu languages, and the first sound film to be made in a language from South India. It was based on the life of the Sanskrit poet Kalidasa; it featured P. G. Venkatesan in the title role and T. P. Rajalakshmi as the female lead, with L. V. Prasad, Thevaram Rajambal, T. Susheela Devi, J. Sushila, and M. S. Santhanalakshmi in supporting roles.  Kalidas, principally in Tamil, contained additional dialogue in Telugu and Hindi. While Rajalakshmi spoke Tamil, Venkatesan spoke only Telugu due to his lack of fluency in Tamil, and Prasad spoke only Hindi. Despite its mythological theme, the film featured songs from much later time periods, such as the compositions of Carnatic musician Tyagaraja, publicity songs of the Indian National Congress, and songs about Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian independence movement. The sound was recorded using German-made technology. Kalidas was shot in Bombay on the sets of India\\'s first sound film  Alam Ara  (1931) and was completed in eight days.

He was also a proponent of greater collaboration between non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and UN agencies. The Prince\\'s interest in ecological issues led him to establish the Bellerive Foundation in the late 1970s, and he was a knowledgeable and respected collector of Islamic art. Born in Paris, France, he was the son of Sir Sultan Mahomed Shah Aga Khan and Princess Andrée Aga Khan. He married twice, but had no children of his own. Prince Sadruddin died of cancer at the age of 70, and was buried in Switzerland.

The election in 1860 for the position of Boden Professor of Sanskrit at the University of Oxford was a competition between two candidates offering different approaches to Sanskrit scholarship. One was Monier Williams, an Oxford-educated Englishman who had spent 14 years teaching Sanskrit to those preparing to work in British India for the East India Company. The other, Max Müller, was a German-born lecturer at Oxford specialising in comparative philology, the science of language. He had spent many years working on an edition of the   Rig Veda   (an ancient collection of Vedic Sanskrit hymns) and had gained an international reputation for his scholarship. Williams, in contrast, worked on later material and had little time for the \"continental\" school of Sanskrit scholarship that Müller exemplified. Williams regarded the study of Sanskrit as a means to an end, namely the conversion of India to Christianity. In Müller\\'s opinion, his own work, while it would assist missionaries, was also valuable as an end in itself. The election came at a time of public debate about Britain\\'s role in India in the wake of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Opinions were divided on whether greater efforts should be made to convert India or whether to remain sensitive to local culture and traditions. Both men battled for the votes of the electorate (the Convocation of the university, consisting of over 3,700 graduates) through manifestos and newspaper correspondence. Williams laid great stress in his campaign on the intention of the original founder of the chair, that the holder should assist in converting India through dissemination of the Christian scriptures. Müller\\'s view was that his work on the  Rig Veda  was of great value for missionary work, and published testimonials accordingly. He also wanted to teach wider subjects such as Indian history and literature to assist missionaries, scholars, and civil servants – a proposal that Williams criticised as not in accordance with the original benefactor\\'s wishes. The rival campaigns took out newspaper advertisements and circulated manifestos, and different newspapers backed each man. Although generally regarded as superior to Williams in scholarship, Müller had the double disadvantage (in the eyes of some) of being German and having liberal Christian views. Some of the newspaper pronouncements in favour of Williams were based on a claimed national interest of having an Englishman as Boden professor to assist with the work of governing and converting India.

Her reign of 63 years and 216 days—which was longer than those of any of her predecessors—constituted the Victorian era. It was a period of industrial, political, scientific, and military change within the United Kingdom, and was marked by a great expansion of the British Empire. In 1876, the British Parliament voted to grant her the additional title of Empress of India. Victoria was the daughter of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn (the fourth son of King George III), and Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. After the deaths of her father and grandfather in 1820, she was raised under close supervision by her mother and her comptroller, John Conroy. She inherited the throne aged 18 after her father\\'s three elder brothers died without surviving legitimate issue. Victoria, a constitutional monarch, attempted privately to influence government policy and ministerial appointments; publicly, she became a national icon who was identified with strict standards of personal morality.

After graduating with degrees in English honours and criminal psychology, Zinta made her acting debut in  Dil Se..  in 1998, followed by a role in  Soldier  in the same year. These performances earned her the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut, and she was later recognised for her role as a teenage single mother in  Kya Kehna  (2000). She subsequently established a career as a leading actress of Hindi cinema with a variety of character types. Her roles, often deemed culturally defiant, along with her unconventional screen persona won her recognition and several accolades. Following critically appreciated roles in  Chori Chori Chupke Chupke  (2001),  Dil Chahta Hai  (2001),  Dil Hai Tumhaara  (2002), and  Armaan  (2003), Zinta received the Filmfare Award for Best Actress for her performance in  Kal Ho Naa Ho  (2003). She starred in two consecutive annual top-grossing films in India,  Koi... Mil Gaya  (2003) and  Veer-Zaara  (2004), and was noted for her portrayal of independent, modern Indian women in  Salaam Namaste  (2005) and  Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna  (2006), top-grossing productions in domestic and overseas markets. For her first international role in the Canadian drama  Heaven on Earth  (2008) she was awarded the Silver Hugo Award for Best Actress and nominated for the Genie Award for Best Actress. She followed this with a hiatus from acting work for several years, with the exception of her self-produced comeback film,  Ishkq in Paris  (2013), which failed to leave a mark.

When the Dominion of Pakistan was formed after the separation of the Indian subcontinent in 1947 when the British left, it was composed of various ethnic and linguistic groups, with the geographically non-contiguous East Bengal province having a mainly ethnic Bengali population. In 1948, the Government of the Dominion of Pakistan ordained as part of Islamization of East Pakistan or East Bengal that Urdu will be the sole federal language, alternately Bengali writing in the Perso-Arabic script or Roman script (Romanisation of Bengali) or Arabic as the state language of the whole of Pakistan was also proposed, sparking extensive protests among the Bengali-speaking majority of East Bengal. Facing rising sectarian tensions and mass discontent with the new law, the government outlawed public meetings and rallies. The students of the University of Dhaka and other political activists defied the law and organised a protest on 21 February 1952. The movement reached its climax when police killed student demonstrators on that day. The deaths provoked widespread civil unrest. After years of conflict, the central government relented and granted official status to the Bengali language in 1956.

Produced by Aanand L. Rai, Ajay Rai, and Alan McAlex under the banners of Colour Yellow Productions and JAR Pictures, the film was co-written by Iyer, Neeraj Singh, Pranjal Choudhary, and Nitesh Tiwari. Swara Bhaskar starred as Chanda Sahay, a high-school drop-out household maid and single mother of a sullen young girl named Apeksha, played by Riya Shukla. The film\\'s theme is a person\\'s right to dream and change their lives, irrespective of social status. Released in India on 22 April 2016, Nil Battey Sannata was distributed by Eros International and garnered critical and audience acclaim. Reviewers praised most aspects of the production, especially its narrative and realism, and the performances of the cast, Bhaskar\\'s in particular. At the 62nd Filmfare Awards, Iyer won the Filmfare Award for Best Debut Director, while Bhaskar and Shukla won the Screen Awards for Best Actress (Critics) and Best Child Artist respectively. The film did well at the box-office, collecting a total of around  ₹69 million (US$830,000) during its entire theatrical run. The same year, the film was remade in Tamil as  Amma Kanakku , with Iyer returning to direct. The following year, it was remade in Malayalam as  Udaharanam Sujatha .

A keen proponent of aerial archaeology, he spent most of his career as the archaeological officer of the Ordnance Survey (OS) and also wrote a range of books on archaeological subjects. Born in Bombay, British India, to a wealthy middle-class Scottish family, Crawford moved to England as an infant and was raised by his aunts in London and Hampshire. He studied geography at Keble College, Oxford, and worked briefly in that field before devoting himself professionally to archaeology. Employed by the philanthropist Henry Wellcome, Crawford oversaw the excavation of Abu Geili in Sudan before returning to England shortly before the First World War. During the conflict he served in both the London Scottish Regiment and the Royal Flying Corps, where he was involved in ground and aerial reconnaissance along the Western Front. After an injury forced a period of convalescence in England, he returned to the Western Front, where he was captured by the German Army in 1918 and held as a prisoner of war until the end of the conflict.

They were historically considered to be one species (P. gangetica) with the Ganges river dolphin and the Indus river dolphin being subspecies (P. g. gangetica and P. g. minor respectively). Genetic and morphological evidence led to their being described as separate species in 2021. The Ganges and Indus river dolphins are estimated to have diverged 550,000 years ago. They are the only living members of the family Platanistidae and the superfamily Platanistoidea. Fossils of ancient relatives date to the late Oligocene.  South Asian river dolphins are small but stocky cetaceans with long snouts or rostra, broad flippers, and small dorsal fins. They have several unusual features. Living in murky river waters, they have eyes that are tiny and lensless; the dolphins rely instead on echolocation for navigation. The skull has large crests over the melon, which help direct their echolocation signals. These dolphins prey mainly on fish and shrimp and hunt them throughout the water column. They are active through the day and are sighted in small groups. Both species are listed as endangered by the IUCN Red List of mammals. Major threats include dams, barrages, fishing nets, and both chemical and acoustic pollution.

A remake of Khan\\'s earlier film  Aurat  (1940), it is the story of a poverty-stricken village woman named Radha (Nargis), who in the absence of her husband, struggles to raise her sons and survive against a cunning money-lender amidst many troubles. The title of the film was chosen to counter American author Katherine Mayo\\'s 1927 polemical book  Mother India , which vilified Indian culture. Mother India metaphorically represents India as a nation in the aftermath of its independence in 1947, and alludes to a strong sense of Indian nationalism and nation-building. Allusions to Hindu mythology are abundant in the film, and its lead character has been seen as a metonymic representation of an Indian woman who reflects high moral values and the concept of what it means to be a mother to society through self-sacrifice. While some authors treat Radha as the symbol of women\\'s empowerment, others see her cast in female stereotypes. The film was shot in Mumbai\\'s Mehboob Studios and in the villages of Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh. The music by Naushad introduced global music, including Western classical music and orchestra, to Hindi cinema.

It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion\\'s pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, lions typically do not actively seek out and prey on humans. The lion inhabits grasslands, savannahs, and shrublands. It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged throughout Africa and Eurasia, from Southeast Europe to India, but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern.

Many Hindu scriptures describe her legend of seduction by the king of the gods Indra, her husband\\'s curse for her infidelity, and her liberation from the curse by the god Rama. Created by the god Brahma as the most beautiful woman, Ahalya was married to the much older Gautama. In the earliest full narrative, when Indra comes disguised as her husband, Ahalya sees through his disguise but nevertheless accepts his advances. Later sources often absolve her of all guilt, describing how she falls prey to Indra\\'s trickery. In all narratives, Ahalya and Indra are cursed by Gautama. The curse varies from text to text, but almost all versions describe Rama as the eventual agent of her liberation and redemption. Although early texts describe how Ahalya must atone by undergoing severe penance while remaining invisible to the world and how she is purified by offering Rama hospitality, in the popular retelling developed over time, Ahalya is cursed to become a stone and regains her human form after she is brushed by Rama\\'s foot.

It is the seventh-largest country by area; the most populous country as of June 2023; and from the time of its independence in 1947, the world\\'s most populous democracy. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia.  Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.Their long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity. Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest. Its evidence today is found in the hymns of the  Rigveda . Preserved by an oral tradition that was resolutely vigilant, the Rigveda records the dawning of Hinduism in India. The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions.By 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism,and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin.Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity, but also marked by the declining status of women, and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief. In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.

The city is credited with being the best livable city, the cleanest city of Tamil Nadu, as well as the fifth safest city for women in India. It is the fourth largest city as well as the fourth largest urban agglomeration in the state. Located 322 kilometres (200 mi) south of Chennai and 374 kilometres (232 mi) north of Kanyakumari, Tiruchirappalli sits almost at the geographic centre of Tamil Nadu state. The Cauvery Delta begins 16 kilometres (9.9 mi) west of the city where the Kaveri river splits into two, forming the island of Srirangam which is now incorporated into the Tiruchirappalli City Municipal Corporation. The city occupies an area of 167.23 square kilometres (64.57 sq mi) and had a population of 916,857 in 2011. Tiruchirappalli\\'s recorded history begins in the 3rd century BC, when it was under the rule of the Cholas. The city has also been ruled by the Mutharaiyars, Pallavas, Pandyas, Vijayanagar Empire, Nayak Dynasty, the Carnatic state and the British. The most prominent historical monuments in Tiruchirappalli include the Rockfort at Teppakulam, the Ranganathaswamy temple at Srirangam dedicated to the reclining form of Hindu God Vishnu, and is also the largest functioning temple in the world, and the Jambukeswarar temple at Thiruvanaikaval, which is also the largest temple for the Hindu God Shiva in the world. The archaeologically important town of Uraiyur, capital of the Early Cholas, is now a neighbourhood in Tiruchirappalli. The city played a critical role in the Carnatic Wars (1746–1763) between the British and the French East India companies.

It is closely related to the Kathiawari breed of the Kathiawar peninsula of Gujarat, with which it shares an unusual inward-curving shape of the ears. It is found in all equine colours, including piebald and skewbald. It is a hardy riding horse; it may exhibit a natural ambling gait. The Rathores, traditional rulers of the Marwar region of western India,were the first to breed the Marwari. Beginning in the 12th century, they espoused strict breeding that promoted purity and hardiness. Used throughout history as a cavalry horse by the people of the Marwar region, the Marwari was noted for its loyalty and bravery in battle. The breed deteriorated in the 1930s, when poor management practices resulted in a reduction of the breeding stock, but today has regained some of its popularity. The Marwari is used for light draught and agricultural work, as well as riding and packing. In 1995, a breed society was formed for the Marwari horse in India. The exportation of Marwari horses was banned for decades, but between 2000 and 2006, a small number of exports were allowed. Since 2008, visas allowing temporary travel of Marwari horses outside India have been available in small numbers. Though they are rare they are becoming more popular outside of India due to their unique looks.

The sole member of the genus Boselaphus, the species was described and given its binomial name by German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas in 1766. The nilgai stands 1–1.5 metres (3.3–4.9 ft) at the shoulder; males weigh 109–288 kilograms (240–635 lb), and the lighter females 100–213 kilograms (220–470 lb). A sturdy thin-legged antelope, the nilgai is characterised by a sloping back, a deep neck with a white patch on the throat, a short crest of hair along the neck terminating in a tuft, and white facial spots. A column of pendant coarse hair hangs from the dewlap ridge below the white patch. Sexual dimorphism is prominent – while females and juveniles are orange to tawny, adult males have a bluish-grey coat. Only males possess horns, which are 15–24 centimetres (5.9–9.4 in) in length. This picture shows a male nilgai in a potato field at Jamtra, in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. \\n     \\n The  Indian roller  (Coracias benghalensis) is a member of the bird family Coraciidae, the rollers. It occurs widely from the Arabian Peninsula to the Indian subcontinent and is designated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. The bird is best known for the aerobatic displays of males during the breeding season. It is commonly found in open grassland and scrub forest habitats, and is often seen perched on roadside bare trees and wires, which give it a good view of the ground below where it finds its prey. Its diet consists mainly of insects such as beetles and grasshoppers, but also includes spiders, scorpions, amphibians and small reptiles. The largest population occurs in India, and several states in India have chosen it as their state bird.

The dance, which has about 40 different movements, involves the swaying of broad hips and the gentle side-to-side movements. \\n     \\n The  southern plains gray langur  (Semnopithecus dussumieri) is a species of Old World monkey native to the Indian subcontinent. It is about 62 cm (24 in) tall and lives in groups in various forest habitats, feeding mainly on leaves, fruit and flowers in the canopy, supplementing these with insects, gum, grasses, herbs and roots. The monkeys are considered sacred in India, and some are used by Hindu priests for religious purposes. They have adapted to living in close proximity to humans in urban settings; they are often fed by humans and accept cakes, millet, and other foods. The species is protected by law in India, but some are still persecuted for damaging crops, hunted for food and captured for pets. This photograph of a female southern plains gray langur was taken in Kanha Tiger Reserve, in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. The park was created on 1 June 1955 and was designated a tiger reserve in 1973. \\n     \\n Unripe drupes of  black pepper  (Piper nigrum) at Trivandrum, Kerala, India. The drupes are cooked briefly in hot water. The heat ruptures cell walls in the pepper, speeding the work of browning enzymes during drying.

Instituted on 2 January 1954, the award is given for \"distinguished service of a high order\", without distinction of race, occupation, position, or sex. The recipients receive a Sanad, a certificate signed by the President of India and a circular-shaped medallion with no monetary association. The recipients are announced every year on Republic Day (26 January) and registered in  The Gazette of India —a publication used for official government notices and released weekly by the Department of Publication, under the Ministry of Urban Development. The conferral of the award is not considered official without its publication in the Gazette. The name of recipient, whose award have been revoked or restored, both of which require the authority of the President, is archived and they are required to surrender their medal when their name is struck from the register; none of the conferments of Padma Bhushan during 1970–1979 have been revoked or restored. The recommendations are received from all the state and the union territory governments, as well as from Ministries of the Government of India, the Bharat Ratna and the Padma Vibhushan awardees, the Institutes of Excellence, the Ministers, the Chief Ministers and the Governors of State, and the Members of Parliament including private individuals. When instituted in 1954, the Padma Bhushan was classified as \"Dusra Varg\" (Class II) under the three-tier Padma Vibhushan awards, which were preceded by the Bharat Ratna in hierarchy. On 15 January 1955, the Padma Vibhushan was reclassified into three different awards as the Padma Vibhushan, the Padma Bhushan and the Padma Shri. The criteria included \"distinguished service of a high order in any field including service rendered by Government servants\", but excluded those working with the public sector undertakings with the exception of doctors and scientists. The 1954 statutes did not allow posthumous awards; this was subsequently modified in the January 1955 statute. The design was also changed to the form that is currently in use; it portrays a circular-shaped toned bronze medallion 1+ 3⁄4  inches (44 mm) in diameter and    1⁄8  inch (3.2 mm) thick.

Instituted on 2 January 1954, the award is given for \"distinguished service of a high order\", without distinction of race, occupation, position, or sex. The recipients receive a Sanad, a certificate signed by the President of India and a circular-shaped medallion with no monetary association. The recipients are announced every year on Republic Day (26 January) and registered in  The Gazette of India , a publication used for official government notices and released weekly by the Department of Publication, under the Ministry of Urban Development. The conferral of the award is not considered official without its publication in the Gazette. The names of recipients whose awards have been revoked or restored, both of which require the authority of the President, are archived, and recipients who are struck from the register are required to surrender their medals; none of the conferments of Padma Bhushan during 1990–1999 have been revoked or restored. The recommendations are received from all the state and the union territory governments, as well as from Ministries of the Government of India, the Bharat Ratna and the Padma Vibhushan awardees, the Institutes of Excellence, the Ministers, the Chief Ministers and the Governors of State, and the Members of Parliament including private individuals. When instituted in 1954, the Padma Bhushan was classified as \"Dusra Varg\" (Class II) under the three-tier Padma Vibhushan awards, which were preceded by the Bharat Ratna in hierarchy. On 15 January 1955, the Padma Vibhushan was reclassified into three different awards as the Padma Vibhushan, the Padma Bhushan and the Padma Shri. The criteria included \"distinguished service of a high order in any field including service rendered by Government servants\", but excluded those working with the public sector undertakings with the exception of doctors and scientists. The 1954 statutes did not allow posthumous awards; this was subsequently modified in the January 1955 statute. The design was also changed to the form that is currently in use; it portrays a circular-shaped toned bronze medallion   1+ 3⁄4  inches (44 mm) in diameter and    1⁄8  inch (3.2 mm) thick. The centrally placed pattern made of outer lines of a square of   1+ 3⁄16  inches (30 mm) side is embossed with a knob carved within each of the outer angles of the pattern. A raised circular space of diameter   1+ 1⁄16  inches (27 mm) is placed at the centre of the decoration. A centrally located lotus flower is embossed on the obverse side of the medal and the text \"Padma\" is placed above and the text \"Bhushan\" is placed below the lotus written in Devanagari script. The State Emblem of India is displayed in the centre of the reverse side, together with the national motto of India, \"Satyameva Jayate\" (Truth alone triumphs) in Devanagari script, which is inscribed on the lower edge. The rim, the edges and all embossing on either side is of standard gold with the text \"Padma Bhushan\" of gold gilt. The medal is suspended by a pink riband   1+ 1⁄4  inches (32 mm) in width with a broad white stripe in the middle. It is ranked fifth in the order of precedence of wearing of medals and decorations of the Indian civilian and military awards.

Constitutionally, the president is elected by an electoral college composed of members drawn from the Pradesh Congress Committees and members of the All India Congress Committee (AICC). In the event of any emergency because of any cause such as the death or resignation of the president elected as above, the most senior general secretary discharges the routine functions of the president until the Working Committee appoints a provisional president pending the election of a regular president by the AICC. The president of the party has effectively been the party\\'s national leader, head of the party\\'s organisation, head of the Working Committee, the chief spokesman, and all chief Congress committees. After the party\\'s foundation in December 1885, Wyomesh Chandra Banerjee became its first president. From 1885 to 1933, the presidency had a term of one year only. From 1933 onwards, there was no such fixed term for the president. During Jawaharlal Nehru\\'s premiership, he rarely held the Presidency of INC, even though he was always head of the Parliamentary Party. Despite being a party with a structure, Congress under Indira Gandhi did not hold any organisational elections after 1978. In 1978, Gandhi split from the INC and formed a new opposition party, popularly called Congress (I), which the national election commission declared to be the real Indian National Congress for the 1980 general election. Gandhi institutionalised the practice of having the same person as the Congress president and the prime minister of India after the formation of Congress (I). Her successors Rajiv Gandhi and P. V. Narasimha Rao also continued that practice. Nonetheless, in 2004, when the Congress was voted back into power, Manmohan Singh became the first and only prime minister not to be the president of the party since establishment of the practice of the president holding both positions.

The state is bordered by Rajasthan to the west, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Delhi to the northwest, Uttarakhand and Nepal to the north, Bihar to the east, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand to the south. It is the fourth-largest Indian state by area covering 243,286 km2 (93,933 sq mi), equal to 7.3 per cent of the total area of India. Lucknow serves as the state capital, with Prayagraj being the judicial capital. It is divided into 18 divisions and 75 districts. On 9 November 2000, a new state, Uttaranchal (now Uttarakhand), was created from Uttar Pradesh\\'s western Himalayan hill region. The two major rivers of the state, the Ganges and its tributary Yamuna, meet at the Triveni Sangam in Prayagraj, a Hindu pilgrimage site. Other notable rivers are Gomti and Saryu. The forest cover in the state is 6.1 per cent of the state\\'s geographical area. The cultivable area is 82 per cent of the total geographical area, and the net area sown is 68.5 per cent of the cultivable area. Uttar Pradesh was established in 1950 after India had become a republic. It is a successor to the United Provinces, established in 1935 by renaming the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, in turn established in 1902 from the North-Western Provinces and the Oudh Province. Though long known for sugar production, the state\\'s economy is now dominated by the services industry. The service sector comprises travel and tourism, hotel industry, real estate, insurance and financial consultancies. The economy of Uttar Pradesh is the third-largest state economy in India, with   ₹ 18.63 lakh crore  (US$220 billion) in gross domestic product and a per capita GSDP of  ₹68,810 (US$820). The High Court of the state is located in Prayagraj. The state contributes 80 seats to the lower house Lok Sabha and 31 seats and the upper house Rajya Sabha.

It is resident in much of its range, but some populations from the more northern parts migrate southwards in autumn. A bird of wetland areas, it can be seen around lakes, rivers, ponds, marshes and on the sea coast. It feeds mostly on aquatic creatures which it catches after standing stationary beside or in the water, or stalking its prey through the shallows. Standing up to 1 metre (3 ft 3 in) tall, adults weigh from 1 to 2 kg (2 to 4 lb). They have a white head and neck with a broad black stripe that extends from the eye to the black crest. The body and wings are grey above and the underparts are greyish-white, with some black on the flanks. The long, sharply pointed beak is pinkish-yellow and the legs are brown.

The Afro-Asian Games was the largest sporting event ever to be held in Hyderabad, and one of the largest in India, second only to the 2010 Commonwealth Games by athletes\\' volume. The scale of these Games exceeds even the two Asian Games held in Delhi in 1951 (both by athletes\\' volume and by number of participating nations) and 1982 (by number of participating nations). More than 2000 athletes from 96 countries competed in the Games. A total of 131 sporting events in eight disciplines were conducted. Also, 120 countries sent 1,565 official representatives to these Games.

According to most traditional accounts, Kanhopatra was a courtesan and dancer.These accounts typically concentrate on her death when she chose to surrender to the Hindu god Vithoba—the patron god of the Varkaris—rather than becoming a concubine of the Badshah (king) of Bidar. She died in the central shrine of Vithoba in Pandharpur. She is the only person whose samadhi (mausoleum) is within the precincts of the temple.

It formed on 4 November in the eastern Bay of Bengal. Moving westward, it quickly organized and developed a well-defined eye. On 6 November, the cyclone struck about 50 km (31 mi) south of Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh at peak intensity. The India Meteorological Department estimated peak winds of 145 km/h (90 mph), while the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assessed peak winds of 215 km/h (135 mph). Soon after landfall, the cyclone weakened and dissipated by 7 November. Ahead of the storm, about 225,000 families evacuated, although many towns lacked proper storm shelters. When the cyclone made landfall, it produced strong winds up to 100 km (62 mi) inland, dropped 210 mm (8.3 in) of rainfall across a 40 km (25 mi) region, and flooded over 250 villages along a 60 km (37 mi) portion of the coast. About 70% of the overall damage was in East Godavari district, where two villages were entirely destroyed. The storm destroyed 241,802 ha (597,510 acres) of crops and killed millions of cattle and chicken. Across Andhra Pradesh, the storm damaged 647,554 houses, including over 10,000 that were destroyed. Overall damage totaled  ₹21.5 billion (equivalent to ₹120 billion or US$1.4 billion in 2023), comparable to a cyclone in 1977 that also hit Andhra Pradesh. There were 1,077 confirmed deaths with many others missing, although many of the dead were washed into the sea and were unlikely to be found. After the storm, the government and local Red Cross chapters helped residents recover from the damage, while the World Bank provided money to better prepare Andhra Pradesh for future storms.

Maudgalyāyana  (Pali:  Moggallāna ), also known as Mahāmaudgalyāyana or by his birth name Kolita, was one of the Buddha\\'s closest disciples. Described as a contemporary of disciples such as Subhuti, Śāriputra ( Pali: Sāriputta ), and Mahākāśyapa (Pali: Mahākassapa), he is considered the second of the Buddha\\'s two foremost male disciples, together with Śāriputra. Traditional accounts relate that Maudgalyāyana and Śāriputra become spiritual wanderers in their youth. After having searched for spiritual truth for a while, they come into contact with the Buddhist teaching through verses that have become widely known in the Buddhist world. Eventually they meet the Buddha himself and ordain as monks under him. Maudgalyāyana attains enlightenment shortly after that. Maudgalyayana and Śāriputra have a deep spiritual friendship. They are depicted in Buddhist art as the two disciples that accompany the Buddha, and they have complementing roles as teachers. As a teacher, Maudgalyayana is known for his psychic powers, and he is often depicted using these in his teaching methods. In many early Buddhist canons, Maudgalyāyana is instrumental in re-uniting the monastic community after Devadatta causes a schism. Furthermore, Maudgalyāyana is connected with accounts about the making of the first Buddha image. Maudgalyāyana dies at the age of eighty-four, killed through the efforts of a rival sect. This violent death is described in Buddhist scriptures as a result of Maudgalyāyana\\'s karma of having killed his own parents in a previous life.

It is based in Ahmedabad. It is one of the major regional and vernacular film industries of the cinema of India, having produced more than one thousand films since its inception. During the silent film era, many individuals in the industry were Gujaratis. The language-associated industry dates back to 1932, when the first Gujarati talkie,  Narsinh Mehta , was released. Until the independence of India in 1947, only twelve Gujarati films were produced. There was a spurt in film production in the 1940s focused on saint, sati or dacoit stories as well as mythology and folktales. In the 1950s–1960s, the trend continued with the addition of films on literary works. In the 1970s, the Government of Gujarat announced a tax exemption and subsidies which resulted in an increase in the number of films, but the quality declined.

Located in Dehradun, Uttarakhand, it was established in 1932 following a recommendation by a military committee set up under the chairmanship of General (later Field Marshal) Sir Philip Chetwode. From a class of 40 male cadets in 1932, IMA now has a sanctioned capacity of 1,650. Cadets undergo a training course varying between 3 and 16 months depending on entry criteria. On completion of the course at IMA cadets are permanently commissioned into the army as Lieutenants. The academy, spread over 1,400 acres (5.7 km2), houses the Chetwode Hall, Khetarpal Auditorium, Somnath Stadium, Salaria Aquatic Centre, Hoshiar Singh Gymnasium and other facilities that facilitate the training of cadets. Cadets in IMA are organized into a regiment with four battalions of four companies each. The academy\\'s mission, to train future military leaders of the Indian Army, goes hand in hand with the character building enshrined in the IMA honour code, warrior code and motto. Cadets take part in a variety of sports, adventure activities, physical training, drills, weapons training and leadership development activities.

The term \\'Burmese Indian\\' refers to a broad range of people from South Asia, most notably from present-day countries such as India and Bangladesh. While Indians have lived in Burma for many centuries, most of the ancestors of the current Burmese Indian community emigrated to Burma from the start of British rule in the mid-19th century to the separation of British Burma from British India in 1937. During colonial times, ethnic Indians formed the backbone of the government and economy serving as soldiers, civil servants, merchants, moneylenders, mobile laborers and dock workers. A series of anti-Indian riots in the 1930s and mass emigration at the onset of the Japanese invasion of Burma in 1942 were followed in the 1960s by the forced migration of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Indians, exacerbated by internal conflict in Myanmar. Burmese Indians today are estimated to account for approximately 5% (about 2.0–2.5 million people) of the population of Burma and are concentrated largely in the two major cities (Yangon and Mandalay) and former colonial towns (Pyin U Lwin and Kalaw). They wield considerable influence and control over the Burmese economy and have a major socio-cultural presence within the country. Amongst the well-known Burmese Indians is S N Goenka, a leading practitioner and teacher of vipassanā meditation and Helen, a well-known Bollywood film actress who is also of Anglo-Burmese descent.

Bhikshtana is depicted as a nude four-armed man adorned with ornaments who holds a begging bowl in his hand and is followed by demonic attendants and love-sick women. Bhikshatana is considered a gentler form of Shiva\\'s fierce aspect Bhairava and a gentle phase between Bhairava\\'s two gruesome forms, one of which decapitates one head of the four headed god Brahma and the other of which kills the god Vishnu\\'s gatekeeper. Bhikshatana is the form of Bhairava that Shiva assumes to atone for his sin of severing Brahma\\'s fifth head. He wanders the universe in the form of a naked Kapali mendicant, begging for alms with Brahma\\'s kapala (skullcup) as his begging bowl, until his sin is expiated upon reaching the holy city of Varanasi.

It was produced by Atul Kasbekar\\'s company, Bling Unplugged, alongside Fox Star Studios. The film stars Sonam Kapoor as the eponymous lead, with Shekhar Ravjiani, Shabana Azmi, Yogendra Tiku, Kavi Shastri and Jim Sarbh in supporting roles. The plot is based on a real-life event: the attempted hijacking of Pan Am Flight 73 in Karachi, Pakistan by Libyan-backed Abu Nidal Organization on 5 September 1986. The film is shown from the point of view of the head purser of the flight, Neerja Bhanot, who thwarted the hijack attempt by alerting the pilots, thus grounding the plane. Bhanot died trying to help save the passengers and crew, of whom 359 of the 379 on board survived.

It includes Departments, which coordinate work on certain tasks, such as peer review or project-wide collaboration and Work Groups, and focus on content and articles related to India, such as cities, politics and culture.\\n     Participation    [  edit  ]    \\nThe details of WikiProject India members can be found at Wikipedia:WikiProject India/Members. Feel free to add your name and join in this initiative. The main page for discussion is Wikipedia:Noticeboard for India-related topics, consider adding it to your watchlist.\\n   Departments    [  edit  ]  \\nDepartments are groups of members who do specific work. Tasks include authoring, maintaining the project pages, administering portals, adding articles, participating in reviews, managing the project and so on. The following is a list of departments within the WikiProject. WikiProject Members may not necessarily do only departmental tasks. They can contribute content as a member of Work Groups as well.\\n   Coverage    [  edit  ]  \\n Refine and maintain the  List of basic India topics , a key guide on Wikipedia to India as a subject. It serves as a table of contents, summary, and topic outline of coverage on the country India and is the most useful tool on Wikipedia for exploring and understanding fundamental material about India (and how it fits together) on Wikipedia. Its purpose is an important one: it simply enables readers to see at a glance how the subject of India is broken down, what the component topics are, and how they relate to each other - that is, how information on India is organized (here, and in the world-at-large). It is a site map and outline of knowledge that demystifies the subject known as \"India\". Because of its central role in the presentation of Wikipedia\\'s coverage of this subject, it is very important to develop and maintain it to the highest level of quality: to help readers improve their conceptual awareness and understanding of India as well as find their way around this subject on Wikipedia. For examples of other pages in this set, see List of basic France topics, List of basic Thailand topics, List of basic Japan topics, List of basic Taiwan topics, and List of basic Iceland topics, all of which are currently completed to a higher level of quality than this page. In other words, much work needs to be done: the List of basic India topics is incomplete, needs your editing contributions, and is especially in need of pictures! \\n   Guide    [  edit  ]  \\nThe  guide  makes a list of tools, scripts and suggestions required for editing WikiProject India related articles.\\n   Assessment    [  edit  ]  \\nThe  assessment department  focuses on assessing the quality of Wikipedia\\'s Indian articles. While much of the work is done in conjunction with the WP:1.0 program, the article ratings are also used within the project itself to aid in recognising excellent contributions and identifying topics in need of further work.\\n The ratings are done in a distributed fashion through parameters in the {{ WikiProject India }} project banner; this causes the articles to be placed in a set of categories that serves as the basis for an automatically generated worklist.\\n   Peer review    [  edit  ]  \\nThe  peer review department  conducts peer reviews of India-related articles on request; this helps to obtain ideas for further improvement by having contributors who may not have previously worked on particular articles examine them.

Read the  search guide .\\n \\n Findsight is a search engine that lets you explore non-fiction content based on claims — the key points made by sources. You can discover and compare claims from various sources, see how authors tackle issues differently, and navigate to related claims to create your own learning journey. You can also find links to the original books or article. This approach is called syntopical reading.\\nNew to Findsight? Click the Random button to explore a random claim and related sources. Click titles for more context around highlighted claims, and use the → arrow to explore more related claims.\\nFilters: Basic Filters\\nFindsight offers basic and AI-powered filters to refine search results. Let\\'s start with the basics.\\nThe mention filter works like Google, finding sources based on literal text. It\\'s a good starting point but may lack precision. For example, searching \"running\" yields results about the sport, running a business, and state-run systems.\\nTo refine results, use the references filter. Type \"running\" and select from suggestions. Suggestions marked \"W\" link to Wikipedia. Others are named entities — concepts referenced across sources, categorized for differentiation:\\n Skill\\nrunning\\nis a named entity, note the category Skill \\n    \\nRun (baseball)\\nis a linked entity, note the Wikipedia icon\\nAdd as many entities as needed, then choose whether a source must contain one or all to match using the dropdown. Clear the input and type something else to find new suggestions.\\nThe discuss filter works like the references filter but targets topics — specific tags linked to a source. Topics appear below each result\\'s title as an expandable list.\\nIn the mention filter input, and in the search input for discuss and reference, you can use prefixes (asterisks) and alternatives using OR, e.g. dus* OR wash* will find both dusting and washrooms.\\nFilters: AI-powered Search\\nNote: You can run 50 searches using AI filters per day. You can run more by removing an AI filter.\\nFindsight\\'s AI-powered filters, state and answer, enable advanced searching.\\nThe state filter, also used by the Random button and explore arrow (→), lets you enter a custom claim and find related claims — useful for citations.\\nThe answer filter finds claims that address a question you enter, providing context and data to help answer it.',\n",

Build models of human cognition and cognition-inspired AI algorithms. Understand limitations of deep learning systems, improve their safety and robustness and address issues including calibration, fairness and explainability of ML solutions. Combine computer vision based methods with personalised knowledge graphs to better understand images. Pursue basic research in HCI, to ensure that our technologies touching end users are informed by an evolved understanding of human factors.   Societal impact  Demonstrate positive societal impact through our research in areas such as health, ecology and wildlife conservation.  Transform healthcare using ML: Our researchers have developed deep learning based solutions for more effective screening of diabetic retinopathy, which are being deployed at hospitals in India. AI for Social Good program to address issues like public health, education and wildlife conservation, in partnership with NGOs and academic researchers, while making fundamental advances to the underlying scientific areas like multi-agent systems, ML and HCI. Develop additional novel solutions focussed on the prevention and wellness for major diseases like CVD and diabetes; improve health outcomes at lower costs and solve for the acute shortage of doctors in countries like India.   Product impact  Make significant improvements to Google products to make them more helpful to our users.  Advance the state of the art and apply ML in areas like natural language understanding (NLU) and user understanding to address the unique challenges in the Indian context (e.g. code mixing in Search, diversity of languages, dialects and accents in Assistant) . Enhance overall capabilities (e.g. ability of the Assistant to handle conversations requiring a combination of knowledge, reasoning and personalization), do better user modeling and to improve fraud detection in GPay. \\n Team focus summaries\\n \\nThe next billion users (NBU) present a unique set of challenges to the search and the advertising business.

In this paper, we propose an evaluation paradigm that assesses NLP technologies across all three dimensions, hence quantifying the diversity of users they can serve. While inclusion and accessibility have received attention in recent literature, quantifying equity is relatively unexplored. We propose to address this gap using the *Gini coefficient*, a well-established metric used for estimating societal wealth inequality. Using our paradigm, we highlight the distressed state of utility and equity of current technologies for Indian (IN) languages. Our focus on IN is motivated by their linguistic diversity and their large, varied speaker population. To improve upon these metrics, we demonstrate the importance of region-specific choices in model building and dataset creation and also propose a novel approach to optimal resource allocation in pursuit of building linguistically diverse, equitable technologies.\\nView details\\nPreview abstract\\nWe explore a fundamental question in language model pre-training with huge amounts of unlabeled and randomly sampled text data - should every data sample have equal contribution to the model learning. To this end, we use self-influence (SI) scores as an indicator of sample importance, analyzing the relationship of self-influence scores with the sample quality and probing the efficacy of SI scores for offline pre-training dataset filtering. Building upon this, we propose PRESENCE: Pre-training data REweighting with Self-influENCE, an online and adaptive pre-training data re-weighting strategy using self-influence scores. PRESENCE is a two-phased learning method: In the first phase of learning, the data samples with higher SI scores are emphasized more, while in the subsequent phase of learning, the data samples with higher SI scores are de-emphasized to limit the impact of noisy and unreliable samples. We validate PRESENCE over $2$ model sizes of multilingual-t5 with $5$ datasets across $3$ tasks, obtaining significant performance improvements over the baseline methods considered. Through extensive ablations and qualitative analyses, we put forward a new research direction for language model pre-training.\\nView details\\nPreview abstract\\nPretrained multilingual models such as mBERT and multilingual T5 (mT5) have been successful at many Natural Language Processing tasks. The shared representations learned by these models facilitate cross lingual transfer in case of low resource settings. In this work, we study the usability of these models for morphology analysis tasks such as root word extraction and morphological feature tagging for Indian langauges. In particular, we use the mT5 model to train gender, number and person tagger for langauges from 2 Indian families. We use data from 6 Indian langauges: Marathi, Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu and Kannada to fine-tune a multilingual GNP tagger and root word extractor.\\nWe demonstrate the usability of multilingual models for few shot cross-lingual transfer through an average 7\\\\% increase in GNP tagging in case of cross-lingual settings as compared to a monolingual setting and through controlled experiments. We also provide insights into cross-lingual transfer of morphological tags for verbs and nouns; which also provides a proxy for quality of the multilingual representations of word markers learned by the model.\\nView details\\nPreview abstract\\nWe present 1-PAGER the first system that answers a question and retrieves evidence using\\na single Transformer-based model and decoding process. 1-PAGER incrementally partitions\\nthe retrieval corpus using constrained decoding to select a document and answer string,\\nand we show that this is competitive with comparable retrieve-and-read alternatives according to both retrieval and answer accuracy metrics. 1-PAGER also outperforms the equivalent ‘closed-book’ question answering model,\\nby grounding predictions in an evidence corpus. While 1-PAGER is not yet on-par with\\nmore expensive systems that read many more\\ndocuments before generating an answer, we argue that it provides an important step toward\\nattributed generation by folding retrieval into\\nthe sequence-to-sequence paradigm that is currently dominant in NLP. We also show that the\\nsearch paths used to partition the corpus are\\neasy to read and understand, paving a way forward for interpretable neural retrieval.\\nView details\\nPreview abstract\\nLearning from label proportions (LLP) is a generalization of supervised learning in which the training data is available as sets or bags of feature-vectors (instances) along with the average instance-label of each bag. The goal is to train a good instance classifier. While most previous works in LLP have focused on training models on such training data, computational learnability in LLP only recently been explored by [Saket21,Saket22], who showed worst case intractability of properly learning linear threshold functions (LTFs) from label proportions while not ruling out efficient algorithms for this problem under distributional assumptions.\\nIn this work we show that it is indeed possible to efficiently learn LTFs using LTFs when given access to random bags of some label proportion in which feature-vectors are independently sampled from a fixed Gaussian distribution N(mu, Sigma), conditioned on the label assigned by the target LTF. Our method estimates a matrix by sampling pairs of feature-vector from the bags with and without replacement, and we prove that the principal component of this matrix necessarily yields the normal vector of the LTF. For some special cases with N(0, I) we provide a simpler expectation based algorithm.\\nWe include an experimental evaluation of our learning algorithms along with a comparison of with those of [Saket21, Saket22] and random LTFs, demonstrating the effectiveness of our techniques.\\nView details\\nPreview abstract\\nThe options framework in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning breaks down overall goals into a combination of options or simpler tasks and associated policies, allowing for abstraction in the action space. Ideally, these options can be reused across different higher-level goals; indeed, many previous approaches have proposed limited forms of transfer of prelearned options to new task settings. We propose a novel \"option indexing\" approach to hierarchical learning (OI-HRL), where we learn an affinity function between options and the functionalities (or affordances) supported by the environment. This allows us to effectively reuse a large library of pretrained options, in zero-shot generalization at test time, by restricting goal-directed learning to only those options relevant to the task at hand. We develop a meta-training loop that learns the representations of options and environment affordances over a series of HRL problems, by incorporating feedback about the relevance of retrieved options to the higher-level goal. In addition to a substantial decrease in sample complexity compared to learning HRL policies from scratch, we also show significant gains over baselines that have the entire option pool available for learning the hierarchical policy.\\nView details\\nPreview abstract\\nInvariant representations are transformations of the covariates such that the best model on top of the representation is invariant across training environments. In the context of linear Structural Equation Models (SEMs), invariant representations might allow us to learn models with out-of-distribution guarantees, i.e., models that are robust to interventions in the SEM. To address the invariant representation problem in a finite sample setting, we consider the notion of $\\\\epsilon$-approximate invariance. We study the following question: If a representation is approximately invariant with respect to a given number of training interventions, will it continue to be approximately invariant on a larger collection of unseen intervened SEMs? Inspired by PAC learning, we obtain finite-sample out-of-distribution generalization guarantees for approximate invariance that holds probabilistically over a family of linear SEMs without faithfulness assumptions.\\nView details\\nPreview abstract\\nStein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) is a popular nonparametric variational inference algorithm which simulates an interacting particle system to approximate a target distribution. While SVGD has demonstrated promising empirical performance across various domains, and its population (i.e, infinite-particle) limit dynamics is well studied, the behavior of SVGD in the finite-particle regime is much less understood. In this work, we design two computationally efficient variants of SVGD, namely VP-SVGD and RB-SVGD, with provably fast finite-particle convergence rates. By introducing the notion of \\\\emph{virtual particles}, we develop novel stochastic approximations of population-limit SVGD dynamics in the space of probability measures, which is exactly implementable using only a finite number of particles. Our algorithms can be viewed as specific random-batch approximations of SVGD, which are computationally more efficient than ordinary SVGD. We establish that the $n$ particles output by VP-SVGD and RB-SVGD, run for $T$ steps, are i.i.d samples from a distribution whose Kernel Stein Discrepancy to the target is at most $O(T^{\\\\nicefrac{-1}{6}})$ under standard assumptions. Our results hold under a mild growth condition on the potential function, which is significantly weaker than the isoperimetric assumptions (e.g. Poincare Inequality) or information-transport conditions (e.g. Talagrand\\'s Inequality $\\\\mathsf{T}_1$) generally considered in prior works. As a corollary, we consider the convergence of the empirical measure (of the particles output by VP-SVGD and RB-SVGD) to the target distribution and demonstrate a \\\\emph{double exponential improvement} over the best known finite-particle analysis of SVGD.\\nView details\\nPreview abstract\\nWe consider regression where the noise distribution depends on the covariates (i.e, heteroscedastic noise), which captures popular settings such as linear regression with multiplicative noise occuring due to covariate uncertainty. In particular we consider linear regression where the noise variance is an unknown rank-1 quadratic function of the covariates. While an application of least squares regression can achieve an error rate of $\\\\nicefrac{d}{n}$, this ignores the fact that the magnitude of the noise can be very small for certain values of the covariates, which can aid faster learning. Our algorithm \\\\ouralg~runs a parameter estimation algorithm and a noise distribution model learning algorithm are run alternately, using each other\\'s outputs to iteratively obtain better estimates of the parameter and the noise distribution model respectively. This achieves an error rate of $\\\\nicefrac{1}{n} + \\\\nicefrac{d^2}{n^2}$, which we show is minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors. A sub-routine for \\\\ouralg~performs phase estimation with multiplicative noise maybe of independent interest.\\nView details\\nPreview abstract\\nCausal effect estimation from data typically requires assumptions about the cause-effect relations either explicitly in the form of a causal graph structure within the Pearlian framework, or implicitly in terms of (conditional) independence statements between counterfactual variables within the potential outcomes framework. When the treatment variable and the outcome variable are confounded, front-door adjustment is an important special case where, given the graph, causal effect of the treatment on the target can be estimated using post-treatment variables. However, the exact formula for front-door adjustment depends on the structure of the graph, which is difficult to learn in practice. In this work, we provide testable conditional independence statements to compute the causal effect using front-door-like adjustment without knowing the graph under limited structural side information. We show that our method is applicable in scenarios where knowing the Markov equivalence class is not sufficient for causal effect estimation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a class of random graphs as well as real causal fairness benchmarks.\\nView details\\n Highlighted work\\n \\n \\nGoogle for India 2022: Driving impact with AI across Indian languages, the agricultural ecosystem, a\\n  \\nGoogle Research’s journey in India in the last three years, along with our partners, has been exciting and rewarding, from finding solutions for Indian language speakers to enabling better maternal healthcare solutions and helping to efficiently diagnose preventable diabetic blindness.

       " 'comprehensive_report': '## Comprehensive Report: 100xEngineers and the Indian Generative AI Landscape\\n\\nThis report synthesizes information from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive overview of 100xEngineers and its place within the broader context of India\\'s rapidly evolving Generative AI landscape.  The analysis reveals a dynamic ecosystem characterized by rapid growth, increasing competition, and significant opportunities.  A key finding is the unsubstantiated nature of the claim that 100xEngineers is \"India\\'s first AI lab focused on Generative AI training.\"\\n\\n**I. The Indian Generative AI Market (2019-2024):**\\n\\nThe Indian AI market, including the Generative AI sub-sector, experienced exponential growth from 2019 to 2024. This growth was fueled by several factors: increased digital adoption, government initiatives (e.g., \"Digital India,\" National AI Strategy), a large pool of engineering talent, and substantial domestic and foreign investment.  Generative AI, initially a niche area, rapidly gained traction from 2020 onwards, creating a significant demand for specialized skills that outpaced supply.  This competitive landscape, initially less crowded, became increasingly saturated as new players entered the market.  Technological advancements in foundation models (LLMs), diffusion models, and multimodal AI continuously reshaped the required skillset for Generative AI engineers.\\n\\n**II. 100xEngineers:  Analysis of the \"First-Mover\" Claim:**\\n\\nThe claim that 100xEngineers is \"India\\'s first AI lab focused on Generative AI training\" requires careful scrutiny.  A definitive answer is hampered by the lack of readily accessible historical records.  However, several points emerge from the analysis:\\n\\n* **Lack of Verifiable Evidence:**  No definitive evidence supports this claim.
