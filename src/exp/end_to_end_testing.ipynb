Here'\\''s a structured approach:\\n\\n### Current User Base Estimation\\n1. **Market Analysis**: \\n   - **USA**: The AI market in the USA is large and diverse, with a strong emphasis on automation, data analytics, and cybersecurity. Bonsen AI can target sectors such as finance, healthcare, and manufacturing.\\n   - **UK**: The UK market also shows strong demand for AI in similar sectors, with additional focus on AI for regulatory compliance and fintech solutions.\\n\\n2. **Current User Base**: Estimate the current user base by analyzing Bonsen AI'\\''s customer acquisition rate, market penetration, and existing contracts or partnerships.\\n\\n### Future Projections\\n1. **Market Growth Rate**:\\n   - Assume a conservative growth rate based on historical data and industry projections. For AI services, a CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of around 20-30% might be realistic given the rapid adoption of AI technologies.\\n\\n2. **Geopolitical Factors**:\\n   - **Wars**: Conflicts can disrupt markets but also increase demand for specific AI applications like cybersecurity or supply chain management. For instance, tensions could lead to higher investments in defense-related AI applications.\\n   - **Climate Change**: This could drive demand for AI in environmental monitoring, disaster response, and sustainable resource management. It might open new sectors for AI applications, increasing the potential user base.\\n\\n3. **Extrapolation Method**:\\n   - Use the current user base and apply the estimated growth rate while adjusting for geopolitical and environmental impacts. For instance, if Bonsen AI currently has 1,000 users in the USA and 500 in the UK, and you expect a 25% growth rate with an additional 10% increase due to climate-related demand:\\n     - **USA**: 1,000 * (1 + 0.25 + 0.10) = 1,350 users projected for the next year.\\n     - **UK**: 500 * (1 + 0.25 + 0.10) = 675 users projected for the next year.\\n\\n### Strategic Considerations\\n- **Diversification**: Bonsen AI should consider diversifying its offerings to include AI solutions for climate resilience and geopolitical stability.\\n- **Partnerships**: Form strategic partnerships with organizations in sectors likely to be affected by these factors.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nBy considering historical growth rates, market trends, and external factors like geopolitical events and climate change, Bonsen AI can strategically plan for an increased user base in both the USA and UK, potentially reaching 1,350 users in the USA and 675 in the UK over the next year.\"\n",

The provided text focuses on market data from 2023 onwards and later developments like ChatGPT.  Image diffusion models, a key aspect of the question, were also not as prominent in 2019 as they are now.  Therefore, a comprehensive analysis for 2019 requires extrapolating from later trends and acknowledging the limitations of available data.\\n\\n**Market Size and Growth (2019):**\\n\\n* **Limited Direct Data:** The provided text doesn\\'t offer 2019 market size figures for the specific combination of edutech, GenAI upskilling, and image diffusion models.  The broader AI in education market was significantly smaller then, with estimates suggesting a value far less than the 2023 figure of USD 3.45 billion.\\n* **Extrapolation:** Based on the substantial CAGR (37.68% and 47.2% in different reports) reported for later years, we can infer that the 2019 market for AI in education, even excluding the niche areas of GenAI and image diffusion, was considerably smaller.  Growth was likely driven by increasing adoption of basic AI tools in education, like automated grading systems and personalized learning platforms.\\n* **Niche Market:**  In 2019, upskilling specifically in GenAI and image diffusion models was likely a nascent, very small niche within the broader AI education market.  These technologies were less mature and less widely understood.\\n\\n**Key Technological Developments (2019):**\\n\\n* **Early Stages of GenAI:** Generative AI models were in their early stages of development in 2019. While some foundational models existed, they weren\\'t as sophisticated or accessible as those seen in 2023 and beyond.  Upskilling opportunities would have been limited and focused on fundamental AI concepts rather than specialized GenAI techniques.\\n* **Image Diffusion Models:** Image diffusion models were also less advanced in 2019.  While research was ongoing, their applications were not as widespread or mature as they became in subsequent years.

The key unifier for products within this category is that they are primarily or singularly focused on serving K-12 academic institutions.\\nK-12 vs. Higher Education Technology\\nThere are some key differences between education technology focused on K-12 and higher education. Distinctions emerge from nuances in each use case. For instance, parents or guardians are more likely to be directly involved in students’ affairs for K-12 students. The platforms themselves may also need to be easier to use for younger students. The administrative side may also be different, since teachers may manage fewer student records, especially primary educators.\\nThese differences will usually lead to unique features among K-12 focused platforms. For instance, parent/guardian portals are usually standard for any platform that includes students’ personal or academic information. The interface and user experience may often more heavily focus on accessibility and ease of use for students and teachers compared to higher education counterparts.\\nDespite these distinctions, there are some products that bridge the divide between K-12 and higher education. This is most common among products that serve both secondary ed and higher ed. These products usually focus on the learning management component of education, such as assessments, grades management, and class discussion forums. Primary education platforms are far less likely to overlap with higher ed products.\\nTypes of K-12 Online Learning Platforms\\nThere are several standard areas of online learning platforms for K-12 schools. Many education tech vendors offer one or multiple products to serve schools’ needs across multiple areas simultaneously. Others specialize as point solutions and rely on integrating with other vendor’s offerings.\\nThe “core” platform for schools is usually their Student Management System, also known as a Student Information System. These systems are the central repository for student data, including class schedules, student enrollment information and personal data, and provide students, parents, and staff access to this data.\\nSchool Management Software is more focused on serving the administrative side of K-12 schools. It is also called “School Administration Software” for the same reason. These systems help staff manage or automate administrative tasks around admissions, scheduling, billing, internal and external communication, and other tasks.\\nK-12 Learning Management Systems focus on the teacher, student, and classroom experience. They specialize in helping teachers create and manage course materials, often including assessment management. LMSs also allow students and parents/guardians to track students’ academic performance. In contrast with Higher Education LMSs, K-12 focused products will often offer more features to facilitate in-classroom learning and engagement.\\nK-12 Online Learning Platform Comparison\\nWhen comparing different K-12 online learning platforms, consider these factors:\\n Centralized Platform vs. Point Solution: Does each product provide a one-stop-shop for multiple functions a school needs, such as SIS and LMS capabilities? If it does not, how well does each point solution integrate with the other systems that the school or district uses? Comparing products’ scopes will help buyers understand the total investment needed to support a K-12 institution and what IT management or maintenance may be required to support multiple systems in the long term.\\n In-Person vs. Remote Learning: For primary education platforms in particular, are there features tailored to the school’s learning environment, whether that is in-person or remote learning? Many products serving younger learners have built out more robust classroom support features of in-person learning, but they may be less helpful or unusable in a remote context. This can leave schools paying for unused features.\\n Pricing: School budgets for education technology can be a substantial limiting factor that varies from district to district. When comparing products, consider the total cost of outfitting a school or district with the necessary education tech, including SMS, LMS, and other needed administrative functions. Evaluating the entire package holistically can help education buyers find the ideal platform deployment to meet their needs.\\nPricing Information\\nPer-student or per-school pricing, usually billed monthly or annually. Individual products can start a $2-10/student/month, but will vary based on volume and how comprehensive a particular product is. More comprehensive products are likely to cost more, but will limit the total number of systems that schools must purchase.\\n  Frequently Asked Questions     What do K-12 online learning platforms do?    K-12 online learning platforms facilitate the administration of K-12 academic institutions and support staff and student management of students’ data.      Who uses K-12 online learning platforms?    K-12 online learning platforms are most heavily used by school staff, such as teachers and administrators.      What’s the difference between K-12 and Higher Education technology?    K-12 online learning platforms will offer more features for parents and guardians to participate in their student’s education and will offer features tailored to younger audiences.      How much do K-12 online learning platforms cost?    Pricing can start as low as $2/student/month, but can scale up beyond $10/student/month for more comprehensive platforms and features.\",\n",
       "    'Although considered a relatively new category in the educational IT world, the work placement systems rely on the old employment agency model. These solutions aim to build relationships between students and employers in a one-stop-shop environment to offer job opportunities.\\nDefinition of a Work Placement System\\nWe could define a work placement system as a tool that offers job opportunities to students. In reality, it is a bit more complex than that. Some solutions focus on internships in the medical field (MD, nursing), while others concentrate on cooperative education, but overall, work placement tools in educational institutions are designed to complement the academic path taken by students.\\nSolutions in this product group may include many experiential learning opportunities: curriculum placement, clinical placement, work experience, internships, industry projects, volunteering, graduate placements and international opportunities. \\nWork placement systems are not career readiness solutions. While career readiness systems aim to equip students with soft skills to succeed in the job market, work placement systems act as a liaison between students and employers.\\nHistory of Cooperative Education and Work Placement Solutions\\nThe work-based learning is not a new concept. Herman Schneider developed the concept of cooperative education when he founded the first co-op program at the University of Cincinnati in 1906. Other universities in North America formalized cooperative education as early as 1910. At first, it was all about engineering (mainly mechanical and automotive), but it later expanded to liberal arts and business. \\nEven if cooperative education is a century-old concept, work placement solutions only emerged at the end of the 20th century in North America. In the US, Symplicity (1996) was one of the first solutions accessible to universities and colleges. Orbis (now part of Symplicity) gained its first contracts in 2002 on the Canadian market. ARC Technologies (1990), a UK company, is probably the first company to have offered work placement solutions to institutions in Europe. However, it is unclear if it offered work placement solutions at its inception.\\nAt first, work placement systems were somewhat an electronic version of the bulletin board with coop and internship placement postings. Some solutions included the matching component with a ranking system in place. We had to wait for the early 2010s to see a massive expansion in this product category. As of 2022, ListedTech tracks twenty products in this product category.\\nMarket Leaders\\n \\nThe work placement category is still growing. Even though we have 2,500 implementations in our database, we consider our data to be preliminary. Within our dataset, the market leaders are Handshake Students, CSM by Symplicity and ACEMAPP Education. Please note that this preliminary data represent implementations in higher education institutions worldwide.\\n \\nWe are in the final phase of releasing our data. Before doing so, we always validate our information with a company that works in the field. If you would like to help, send us an email.']},\n",

       "    'If you are coming up short on results, there are a a few strategies that may help expand your search.\\n1. Harvest Additional Synonyms\\nSurvey your initial search results to identify any additional keywords or synonyms that might broaden the search. Consider acronyms, spelling variants and alternative phrases and integrate them into the search with the Boolean operator OR. \\nIntegrating synonyms with the Boolean operator OR will typically increase the number of search results\\n Search Query \\n Results \\ncontraception AND Obamacare\\n91\\ncontraception AND (Obamacare OR \"Affordable Care Act\" OR ACA OR \"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\" OR PPACA)\\n219\\n2. \"Explode\" Your Subject Headings\\n\"Exploding\" a subject heading means asking the database to retrieve articles with that subject heading, as well as articles that have been tagged with terms that are under that term in the subject heading tree. For instance, in CINAHL, exploding the term \"Telehealth\" would include narrower terms like \"Telemedicine\" and \"Telenursing\".\\n \\nSearching with a subject heading exploded retrieves a greater number of results\\n Search Query \\n Results \\n(MH \"Telehealth\") \\n9,500\\n(MH \"Telehealth+\") \\n26,000\\nPubMed automatically explodes MeSH terms to include narrower subject headings.\\nAlso see:\\nEBSCOConnect : \"In a Thesaurus or MeSH search in EBSCOhost, what does it mean to explode a term?\" \\n3. Truncate One or More Search Term\\nTruncation symbols in a database (such as \"*\" or \"?\") allow you to search on a root word and include plurals or variants.\\nFor example:\\n diabet* retrieves diabetes OR diabetic OR diabetogenic \\n autis* retrieves autism OR autistic \\n nurs* retrieves nurse OR nursing OR nursing \\nBe aware that truncation may also retrieve false hits. For instance, a search on nurs* would also retrieve “nursery school”. Using a shorter root word will likely map to more variants, while using a longer root word will be more specific. \\n4. Snowballing / Pearl Growing\\n\"Citation pearl growing\" uses a relevant source to lead to more sources on a topic. In the database records, look for link to \"related\" articles or “find similar results.\" \\nAlso consider mining the reference list to follow up on citations that may be relevant. Review articles, including systematic reviews, can be a goldmine of related literature. \\nSimilarly, you can perform \\'cited reference searching\\' to track additional articles that have cited a particular, relevant study. \\n \\nFinally, if you find that much of the relevant literature on your topic of interest is published in a small handful of journals, you could also \"hand search\" the tables of content for those journals by accessing them through the library catalog.']},\n",

Search operators can be useful for everything from content research to technical SEO audits.\\nHow do I use search operators?\\nYou can enter search operators directly into the Google search box, just as you would a text search:\\n \\nExcept in special cases (such as the “in” operator), Google will return standard organic results.\\nGoogle search operators cheat sheet\\nYou can find all of the major organic search operators below, broken up into three categories: “Basic”, “Advanced”, and “Unreliable”. Basic search operators are operators that modify standard text searches.\\n   I. Basic search operators     \" \"   \"nikola tesla\"  Put any phrase in quotes to force Google to use exact-match. On single words, prevents synonyms.   OR   tesla OR edison  Google search defaults to logical AND between terms. Specify \"OR\" for a logical OR (ALL-CAPS).   |   tesla | edison  The pipe (|) operator is identical to \"OR\". Useful if your Caps-lock is broken :)   ( )   (tesla OR edison) alternating current  Use parentheses to group operators and control the order in which they execute.   -   tesla -motors  Put minus (-) in front of any term (including operators) to exclude that term from the results.   *   tesla \"rock * roll\"  An asterisk (*) acts as a wild-card and will match on any word.   #..#   tesla announcement 2015..2017  Use (..) with numbers on either side to match on any integer in that range of numbers.   $   tesla deposit $1000  Search prices with the dollar sign ($). You can combine ($) and (.) for exact prices, like $19.99.   €   €9,99 lunch deals  Search prices with the Euro sign (€). Most other currency signs don\\'t seem to be honored by Google.    in   250 kph in mph  Use \"in\" to convert between two equivalent units. This returns a special, Knowledge Card style result.   \\nAdvanced search operators are special commands that modify searches and may require additional parameters (such as a domain name). Advanced operators are typically used to narrow searches and drill deeper into results.\\n   II. Advanced search operators     intitle:   intitle:\"tesla vs edison\"  Search only in the page\\'s title for a word or phrase. Use exact-match (quotes) for phrases.   allintitle:   allintitle: tesla vs edison  Search the page title for every individual term following \"allintitle:\". Same as multiple intitle:\\'s.   inurl:   tesla announcements inurl:2016  Look for a word or phrase (in quotes) in the document URL. Can combine with other terms.   allinurl:   allinurl: amazon field-keywords nikon  Search the URL for every individual term following \"allinurl:\". Same as multiple inurl:\\'s.   intext:   intext:\"orbi vs eero vs google wifi\"  Search for a word or phrase (in quotes), but only in the body/document text.   allintext:   allintext: orbi eero google wifi  Search the body text for every individual term following \"allintext:\". Same as multiple intexts:\\'s.   filetype:   \"tesla announcements\" filetype:pdf  Match only a specific file type. Some examples include PDF, DOC, XLS, PPT, and TXT.   related:   related:nytimes.com  Return sites that are related to a target domain. Only works for larger domains.   AROUND(X)   tesla AROUND(3) edison  Returns results where the two terms/phrases are within (X) words of each other.   \\nUnreliable operators have either been found to produce inconsistent results or have been deprecated altogether. The \"link:\" operator was officially deprecated in early 2017. It appears that \"inanchor:\" operators are still in use, but return very narrow and sometimes unreliable results. Use link-based operators only for initial research.\\n   III. Unreliable/deprecated operators     ~   ~cars  Include synonyms. Seems to be unreliable, and synonym inclusion is default now.   +   +cars  Force exact-match on a single phrase. Deprecated with the launch of Google+.   daterange:   tesla announcements daterange:2457663-2457754  Return results in the specified range. Can be inconsistent. Requires Julian dates.   link:   link:nytimes.com  Find pages that link to the target domain. This operator was deprecated in early 2017.   inanchor:   inanchor:\"tesla announcements\"  Find pages linked to with the specified anchor text/phrase. Data is heavily sampled.   allinanchor:   allinanchor: tesla announcements  Find pages with all individual terms after \"inanchor:\" in the inbound anchor text.   \\nNote that, for all of the \"allin...:\" operators, Google will try to apply the operator to every term following it. Combining \"allin...:\" operators with any other operators will almost never produce the desired results.\\nSearch operator tips &amp; tricks\\nHaving all of the pieces is only the first step in building a puzzle. The real power of search operators comes from combining them.\\n1. Chain together operator combos\\nYou can chain together almost any combination of text searches, basic operators, and advanced operators:\\n\"nikola tesla\" intitle:\"top 5..10 facts\" -site:youtube.com inurl:2015\\nThis search returns any pages that mention \"Nikola Tesla\" (exact-match), have the phrase \"Top (X) facts\" in the title, where X ranges from 5 to 10, are not on YouTube.com, and have \"2015\" somewhere in the URL.\\n2. Hunt down plagiarized content\\nTrying to find out if your content is unique or if someone is plagiarizing you? Use a unique phrase from your text, put it in quotes (exact-match) after an \"intext:\" operator, and exclude your own site with \"-site:\"...\\nintext:\"they were frolicking in our entrails\" -site:moz.com\\nSimilarly, you can use \"intitle:\" with a long, exact-match phrase to find duplicate copies of your content.\\n3. Audit your HTTP-&gt;HTTPS transition\\nSwitching a site from HTTP to HTTPS can be challenging. Double-check your progress by seeing how many of each type of page Google has indexed. Use the \"site:\" operator on your root domain and then exclude HTTPS pages with \"-inurl:\"...\\nsite:moz.com -inurl:https\\nThis will help you track down any stragglers or find pages that might not have been re-crawled by Google.\\nThese are just a few examples of a nearly infinite set of combinations. Looking for more examples? You\\'re in luck! We\\'ve created a mega-list of 67 examples to catapult you toward site operator mastery.\\nRise in the rankings with Moz Pro\\nWith top-notch link and keyword data and in-depth analytics, Moz Pro provides the tracking and insights you need to reach #1.

This ultimate guide contains all of Google\\'s search string parameters. you can also build your own advanced search using google\\'s advanced search form.\\nhttp://www.google.com/search?\\nGoogle\\'s URL. You\\'ll see it if you look at the address bar, or Chrome omnibar.\\nq=query+goes+here\\nThe query string. Words are separated by + signs.\\nEverything from here on in is preceded by an &amp; sign, as it\\'s tagged on to the end. Here\\'s where things get interesting...\\n 1. Exact match query \\nas_epq=query+goes+here\\nResults must include the query, in the word order displayed.\\n Shows as \"query goes here\" \\n    2. Advanced \"Or\" filter  \\nas_oq=\"query+string\"+goes+here\\nResults must include one or more of the words in this string. \\nBasically, it\\'s like a more advanced version of the one above, using an \"or\" filter. Thus, every result must have the main initial query, and one or more of the sets of terms in these strings.\\n Shows as \"query string\" OR goes OR here     3. Negative Keywords  \\nas_eq=don\\'t+include+these+words\\nResults must NOT include any words in this string.\\n Shows as -don\\'t -include -these -words \\n 4. Limit the number of results  \\nnum=xx\\nControls the number of results shown. \\nMust be a numeric value, and can be anything up to 100. Doesn\\'t work with fractions.\\n 5. Filetype match \\nas_filetype=extension\\nOnly returns results that end in .extension. Currently supports any input. Try it - make a file with a random extension, get it indexed and do a search. Also shows that as long as it validates to something.\\n Shows as filetype:extension \\n 6. Limit results to one site  \\nas_sitesearch=example.com\\nLimits results to just the site you choose.\\n Shows as site:example.com \\n 7. Find results from specific dates   \\nas_qdr=x\\nSwap out x for the following to limit the search to only files first indexed in:\\n d - the previous 24 hours w - the previous seven days m - the previous month y - past year mn - the previous n number of months. So m2 would be the previous two, m3 would be three, and so on. Does work into double digits \\n 8. Find pages with specific usage rights \\nas_rights=xxx\\nLimits the search to files/pages that have certain rights. The options are:\\n (cc_publicdomain|cc_attribute|cc_sharealike|cc_noncommercial|cc_nonderived) - free to use or share (cc_publicdomain|cc_attribute|cc_sharealike|cc_nonderived).-(cc_noncommercial) - free to use or share, including commercially (cc_publicdomain|cc_attribute|cc_sharealike|cc_noncommercial).-(cc_nonderived) - free to use, share, or modify (cc_publicdomain|cc_attribute|cc_sharealike).-(cc_noncommercial|cc_nonderived) - free to use, share, or modify commercially \\nIf you want to make up your own, put the bits you want in brackets, separated by pipe characters (|), and exclude the bits you don\\'t by putting them in brackets, preceded by .- and again pipe-separated.\\n 9. Do an allintitle search as a query string \\nallintitle%3Asearch+terms\\nThis is actually appended to the q= parameter, hence a search for fishing with the allintitle term \"sea bass\" would require the following query:\\nq=fishing+allintitle%3Asea+bass\\n Shows as allintitle:search terms \\nN.B. This also works with allintext to search page body text, allinurl for searching the URL, and allinanchor for finding sites that are linked to with certain anchor text.   \\n 10. Find products in a specific price range \\nnnn..yyyy\\nLike the allin parameters, this is actually appended to the q= parameter. What this does though is let you search for results between numeric ranges. For example, if you wanted to find documents with numbers between 15 and 100, you\\'d put in 15..100. Very useful for finding products in a price range, when combined with the site limiter. Works with $, £, and other such things.\\n Shows as query 15..100 \\n 11. Do + searches as a query string  \\n%2Bterm\\nAgain, this is appended to the q= parameter. The %2B is actually the + sign encoded, and will return results featuring only the term used, with no pluralisations, alternate tenses, or synonyms.\\n Shows as +term \\n        12. Find results for your search term, and synonyms    \\n~term\\nAnother one that\\'s appended to the q= parameter. Returns results for the term used and synonyms.\\n Shows as ~term \\n      13. Find definitions for your search term    \\ndefine%3Aword\\nYet another q= parameter add-on. Returns definitions for the word you put in.\\n Shows as define:word \\n 14. Find results for two words that can have other words in between  \\nterm * term two\\nAnd another q= parameter add-on. Returns results with listings that contain both words, with other words between them.\\n 15. Use Google\\'s calculator via query string \\nn+n2, n-n2, n/n2, n*n2, n^n2 and n% of n2\\nGoogle\\'s calculator functions. They are, in order, add, subtract, divide, multiply, raise to the power of, and return x percentage of.\\n 16. Modify safe search \\nsafe=active\\nSets safe search to on. To turn it off, change active to images.\\n 17. Find similar sites \\nas_rq=example.com\\nFinds sites Google thinks are related to the URL you put in.\\n Shows as query related:example.com \\n   18. View a site\\'s backlinks  \\nas_lq=example.com\\nFinds sites that link to the URL you put in.\\n Shows as query link:example.com \\n 19. Open a new window  \\nnewwindow=n\\nOpens clicked listings in a new window. Very useful for opening lots of documents at a time, for competitor research. Set to 1 to activate, and 0 to turn it off.\\n 20  . Modify personalized search  \\npws\\nControls whether personalised search is on or not. Set to 1 to activate, and 0 to turn it off.\\n 21 . Stop Adwords from collecting data \\nadtest=on\\nTurns off AdWords database connection, so your browsing won\\'t show up as an impression, and will disable the URLs. Set to on to activate, and off to turn it off.\\n 22 . Simulate a button click \\nbtnG=Search\\nSimulates a click on the normal Google results buttom. Change to btnI to get the I\\'m Feeling Lucky button result.\\n 23 . Change input encoding settings \\nie=\\nControls the input encoding settings. This defaults to UTF-8, and is worked out server-side, hence changing it doesn\\'t do anything.\\n 24 . Change output encoding settings \\noe=\\nControls the output encoding settings. Works in the same way as ie, so you can tinker away, but it won\\'t do anything.\\n 25 . Change language \\n&amp;hl=value\\nChanges the interface language. I won\\'t list them all here, but you can find them all here. \\n 26 . Limit languages \\nlr=value\\nLimits the languages used to return results. Not hugely effective. That said, here\\'s the list of all of them:\\n lang_ar - Arabic lang_hy - Armenian lang_be - Belarusian lang_bg - Bulgarian lang_ca - Catalan lang_hr - Croatian lang_cs - Czech lang_da - Danish lang_nl - Dutch lang_en - English lang_eo - Esperanto lang_et - Estonian lang_tl - Filipino lang_fi - Finnish lang_fr - French lang_de - German lang_el - Greek lang_iw - Hebrew lang_hu - Hungarian lang_is - Icelandic lang_id - Indonesian lang_it - Italian lang_ja - Japanese lang_ko - Korean lang_lv - Latvian lang_lt - Lithuanian lang_no - Norwegian lang_fa - Persian lang_pl - Polish lang_pt - Portuguese lang_ro - Romanian lang_ru - Russian lang_sr - Serbian lang_sk - Slovak lang_sl - Slovenian lang_es - Spanish lang_sv - Swedish lang_th - Thai lang_tr - Turkish lang_uk - Ukrainian lang_vi - Vietnamese lang_zh-CN - Chinese Simplified lang_zh-TW - Chinese Traditional \\n 27 . Only view pages from certain locations \\ncr=countryXX\\nLimits the search results to pages/sites from certain locations. Change XX to any of the following, to limit the results:\\n AF - Afghanistan AL - Albania DZ - Algeria AS - American Samoa AD - Andorra AO - Angola AI - Anguilla AQ - Antarctica AG - Antigua and Barbuda AR - Argentina AM - Armenia AW - Aruba AU - Australia AT - Austria AZ - Azerbaijan BS - Bahamas BH - Bahrain BD - Bangladesh BB - Barbados BY - Belarus BE - Belgium BZ - Belize BJ - Benin BM - Bermuda BT - Bhutan BO - Bolivia BA - Bosnia and Herzegovina BW - Botswana BV - Bouvet Island BR - Brazil IO - British Indian Ocean Territory VG - British Virgin Islands BN - Brunei BG - Bulgaria BF - Burkina Faso BI - Burundi KH - Cambodia CM - Cameroon CA - Canada CV - Cape Verde KY - Cayman Islands CF - Central African Republic TD - Chad CL - Chile CN - China CX - Christmas Island CC - Cocos (Keeling) Islands CO - Colombia KM - Comoros CG - Congo - Brazzaville CD - Congo - Kinshasa CK - Cook Islands CR - Costa Rica CI - Cote d\\'Ivoire HR - Croatia CU - Cuba CY - Cyprus CZ - Czech Republic DK - Denmark DJ - Djibouti DM - Dominica DO - Dominican Republic EC - Ecuador EG - Egypt SV - El Salvador GQ - Equatorial Guinea ER - Eritrea EE - Estonia SZ - Eswatini ET - Ethiopia FK - Falkland Islands (Malvinas) FO - Faroe Islands FJ - Fiji FI - Finland FR - France GF - French Guiana PF - French Polynesia TF - French Southern Territories GA - Gabon GM - Gambia GE - Georgia DE - Germany GH - Ghana GI - Gibraltar GR - Greece GL - Greenland GD - Grenada GP - Guadeloupe GU - Guam GT - Guatemala GN - Guinea GW - Guinea-Bissau GY - Guyana HT - Haiti HM - Heard and McDonald Islands VA - Holy Sea HN - Honduras HK - Hong Kong HU - Hungary IS - Iceland IN - India ID - Indonesia IQ - Iraq IE - Ireland IL - Israel IT - Italy JM - Jamaica JP - Japan JO - Jordan KZ - Kazakhstan KE - Kenya KI - Kiribati KP - Korea, Democratic People\\'s Republic of KR - Korea, Republic of KW - Kuwait KG - Kyrgyzstan LA - Lao People\\'s Democratic Republic LV - Latvia LB - Lebanon LS - Lesotho LR - Liberia LY - Libyan Arab Jamahiriya LI - Liechtenstein LT - Lithuania LU - Luxembourg MO - Macau MK - Macedonia MG - Madagascar MW - Malawi MY - Malaysia MV - Maldives ML - Mali MT - Malta MH - Marshall Islands MQ - Martinique MR - Mauritania MU - Mauritius YT - Mayotte MX - Mexico FM - Micronesia, Federated States of MD - Moldova, Republic of MC - Monaco MN - Mongolia MS - Montserrat MA - Morocco MZ - Mozambique MM - Myanmar NA - Namibia NR - Nauru NP - Nepal NL - Netherlands AN - Netherlands Antilles NC - New Caledonia NZ - New Zealand NI - Nicaragua NE - Niger NG - Nigeria NU - Niue NF - Norfolk Island MP - Northern Mariana Islands NO - Norway OM - Oman PK - Pakistan PW - Palau PS - Palestinian Territory PA - Panama PG - Papua New Guinea PY - Paraguay PE - Peru PH - Philippines PN - Pitcairn PL - Poland PT - Portugal PR - Puerto Rico QA - Qatar RE - Reunion RO - Romania RU - Russian Federation RW - Rwanda SH - Saint Helena KN - Saint Kitts and Nevis LC - Saint Lucia PM - Saint Pierre &amp; Miquelon VC - Saint Vincent and the Grenadines WS - Samoa SM - San Marino ST - Sao Tome and Principe SA - Saudi Arabia SN - Senegal CS - Serbia and Montenegro SC - Seychelles SL - Sierra Leone SG - Singapore SK - Slovakia SI - Slovenia SB - Solomon Islands SO - Somalia ZA - South Africa GS - South Georgia and The South Sandwich Islands ES - Spain LK - Sri Lanka SD - Sudan SR - Suriname SJ - Svalbard &amp; Jan Mayen SE - Sweden CH - Switzerland SY - Syrian Arab Republic TW - Taiwan TJ - Tajikistan TZ - Tanzania TH - Thailand TL - Timor-Leste TG - Togo TK - Tokelau TO - Tonga TT - Trinidad and Tobago TN - Tunisia TR - Turkey TM - Turkmenistan TC - Turks and Caicos Islands TV - Tuvalu UG - Uganda UA - Ukraine AE - United Arab Emirates GB - United Kingdom US - United States UM - United States Minor Outlying Islands UY - Uruguay UZ - Uzbekistan VU - Vanuatu VE - Venezuela VN - Viet Nam VG - Virgin Islands (British) VI - Virgin Islands (U.S.) WF - Wallis and Futuna Islands EH - Western Sahara YE - Yemen ZM - Zambia ZW - Zimbabwe \\nKeep learning\\n  Mastering Google Search Operators in 67 Easy Steps   SEO Essentials Certification   Beginner\\'s Guide to SEO: How Search Engines Work: Crawling, Indexing, and Ranking   \\n \\nPut your skills to work\\nGauge a Site\\'s Influence with Link Explorer\\nLink Explorer is a link popularity and backlink analysis tool that lets you research and compare any site on the web.',\n",

[9]  The top-level domain names are installed in the root zone of the name space. For all domains in lower levels, it is the last part of the domain name, that is, the last non-empty label of a fully qualified domain name. For example, in the domain name www.example.com, the top-level domain is .com. Responsibility for management of most top-level domains is delegated to specific organizations by the ICANN, an Internet multi-stakeholder community, which operates the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), and is in charge of maintaining the DNS root zone.\\n History  [  edit  ]  \\nOriginally, the top-level domain space was organized into three main groups: Countries, Categories, and Multiorganizations. [10]  An additional temporary group consisted of only the initial DNS domain, .arpa, [11]  and was intended for transitional purposes toward the stabilization of the domain name system.\\n Types  [  edit  ]  \\nAs of 2015, IANA distinguishes the following groups of top-level domains: [12] \\n  Infrastructure top-level domain (ARPA): This group consists of one domain, the Address and Routing Parameter Area. It is managed by IANA on behalf of the Internet Engineering Task Force for various purposes specified in the Request for Comments publications.\\n Generic top-level domains (gTLD): Top-level domains with three or more characters\\nGeneric restricted top-level domains (grTLD): These domains are managed under official ICANN-accredited registrars.\\n Sponsored top-level domains (sTLD): These domains are proposed and sponsored by private agencies or organizations that establish and enforce rules restricting the eligibility to use the TLD. Use is based on community theme concepts; these domains are managed under official ICANN accredited registrars.\\n country-code top-level domains (ccTLD): Two-letter domains established for countries or territories. With some historical exceptions, the code for any territory is the same as its two-letter ISO 3166 code.\\n  Internationalized country code top-level domains (IDN ccTLD): ccTLDs in non-Latin character sets (e.g., Arabic, Cyrillic, Greek, Hebrew, or Chinese).  \\n Test top-level domains (tTLD): These domains were installed under .test for testing purposes in the IDN development process; these domains are not present in the root zone. \\nCountries are designated in the Domain Name System by their two-letter ISO country code; [13]  there are exceptions, however (e.g., .uk). This group of domains is, therefore, commonly known as country-code top-level domains (ccTLD). Since 2009, countries with non–Latin-based scripts may apply for internationalized country code top-level domain names, which are displayed in end-user applications in their language-native script or alphabet, but use a Punycode-translated ASCII domain name in the Domain Name System.\\n Generic top-level domains (formerly categories) initially consisted of .gov, .edu, .com, .mil, .org, and .net. More generic TLDs have been added, such as .info.\\n The authoritative list of current TLDs in the root zone is published at the IANA website at https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db/.\\n Internationalized country code TLDs  [  edit  ]  \\nAn internationalized country code top-level domain (IDN ccTLD) is a top-level domain with a specially encoded domain name that is displayed in an end-user application, such as a web browser, in its language-native script or alphabet (such as the Arabic alphabet), or a non-alphabetic writing system (such as Chinese characters). IDN ccTLDs are an application of the internationalized domain name (IDN) system to top-level Internet domains assigned to countries, or independent geographic regions.\\n ICANN started to accept applications for IDN ccTLDs in November 2009, [14]  and installed the first set into the Domain Names System in May 2010. The first set was a group of Arabic names for the countries of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. By May 2010, 21 countries had submitted applications to ICANN, representing 11 scripts. [15] \\n Infrastructure domain  [  edit  ]  \\nThe domain .arpa was the first Internet top-level domain. It was intended to be used only temporarily, aiding in the transition of traditional ARPANET host names to the domain name system. However, after it had been used for reverse DNS lookup, it was found impractical to retire it, and is used today exclusively for Internet infrastructure purposes such as in-addr.arpa for IPv4 and ip6.arpa for IPv6 reverse DNS resolution, uri.arpa and urn.arpa for the Dynamic Delegation Discovery System, and e164.arpa for telephone number mapping based on NAPTR DNS records. For historical reasons, .arpa is sometimes considered to be a generic top-level domain. [16] \\n Reserved domains  [  edit  ]  \\nA set of domain names is reserved [17]   [18]  by the Internet Engineering Task Force as special-use domain names per authority of Request for Comments (RFC) 6761. The practice originated in RFC 1597 for reserved address allocations in 1994, and reserved top-level domains in RFC 2606 of 1999. RFC 6761 reserves the following four top-level domain names to avoid confusion and conflict. [19]  Any such reserved usage of those TLDs should not occur in production networks that utilize the global domain name system:\\n  .example – reserved for use in examples\\n .invalid – reserved for use in invalid domain names\\n .localhost – reserved to avoid conflict with the traditional use of localhost as a hostname\\n .test – reserved for use in tests \\nRFC 6762 reserves the use of .local for link-local host names that can be resolved via the multicast DNS name resolution protocol. [20] \\n RFC 7686 reserves the use of .onion for the self-authenticating names of Tor onion services. These names can only be resolved by a Tor client because of the use of onion routing to protect the anonymity of users. [21] \\n ICANN proposed the use of .internal on 2024-01-24 [22]  with request for feedback. In 2017 an Internet-Draft draft-wkumari-dnsop-internal-00 already proposed reserving the use of .internal for \"names which do not have meaning in the global context but do have meaning in a context internal to their network\", and for which the RFC 6761 reserved names are semantically inappropriate.\\n Historical domains  [  edit  ]  \\nIn the late 1980s, InterNIC created the .nato domain for use by NATO.[  citation needed  ] NATO considered none of the then-existing TLDs as adequately reflecting their status as an international organization. Soon after this addition, however, InterNIC also created the .int TLD for the use by international organizations in general, and persuaded NATO to use the second level domain nato.int instead. The nato TLD, no longer used, was finally removed in July 1996.[  citation needed  ]\\n Other historical TLDs are .cs for Czechoslovakia (now using .cz for Czech Republic and .sk for Slovakia), .dd for East Germany (using .de after reunification of Germany), .yu for SFR Yugoslavia and Serbia and Montenegro (now using .ba for Bosnia and Herzegovina, .hr for Croatia, .me for Montenegro, .mk for North Macedonia, .rs for Serbia and .si for Slovenia), .zr for Zaire (now .cd for the Democratic Republic of the Congo), and .an for Netherlands Antilles (now .aw for Aruba, .cw for Curaçao and .sx for Sint Maarten). In contrast to these, the TLD .su has remained active despite the demise of the Soviet Union that it represents. Under the chairmanship of Nigel Roberts, ICANN\\'s ccNSO is working on a policy for the retirement of ccTLDs that have been removed from ISO 3166.\\n Proposed domains  [  edit  ]  \\nAround late 2000, ICANN discussed and finally introduced [23]  .aero, .biz, .coop, .info, .museum, .name, and .pro TLDs. Site owners argued that a similar TLD should be made available for adult and pornographic websites to settle the dispute of obscene content on the Internet, to address the responsibility of US service providers under the US Communications Decency Act of 1996. Several options were proposed including xxx, sex and adult. [24]  The .xxx top-level domain eventually went live in 2011. [25] \\n An older proposal consisted of seven new gTLDs: arts, firm, .info, nom, rec, .shop, and .web. [26]  Later .biz, .info, .museum, and .name covered most of these old proposals.\\n During the 32nd International Public ICANN Meeting in Paris in 2008, ICANN started a new process of TLD naming policy to take a \"significant step forward on the introduction of new generic top-level domains\". [27]  This program envisioned the availability of many new or already proposed domains, as well as a new application and implementation process. [28]  Observers believed that the new rules could result in hundreds of new gTLDs being registered. [29] \\n On 13 June 2012, ICANN announced nearly 2,000 applications for top-level domains, which began installation throughout 2013. [30]   [31]  The first seven – bike, clothing, guru, holdings, plumbing, singles, and ventures – were released in 2014. [32] \\n Rejected domains  [  edit  ]  \\nICANN rejected several proposed domains to include .home and .corp due to conflicts regarding gTLDs that are in use in internal networks.\\n Investigation into the conflicts was conducted at ICANN\\'s request by Interisle Consulting. The resulting report was to become known as the Name Collision [33]  issue, which was first reported at ICANN 47. [34] \\n Dotless domains  [  edit  ]  \\n     .org[.] is a node in the DNS tree, just like wikipedia.[org.] and en.[wikipedia.org.]. As such, it has its own DNS records. \\nDue to the structure of DNS, each node in the tree has its own collection of records, and since top-level domains are nodes in DNS, they have records of their own. For example, querying org itself (with a tool such as dig, host, or nslookup) returns information on its nameservers:\\nQUESTION\\norg. IN ANY\\nANSWER\\norg. 21599 IN NS a0.org.afilias-nst.info.\\norg. 21599 IN NS a2.org.afilias-nst.info.\\norg. 21599 IN NS b0.org.afilias-nst.org.\\norg. 21599 IN NS b2.org.afilias-nst.org.\\n[…]\\n Dotless domains are top-level domains that take advantage of that fact, and implement A, AAAA or MX DNS records to serve webpages or allow incoming email directly on a TLD – for example, a webpage hosted on http://example/, or an email address user@example. [35] \\n  ICANN and IAB have spoken out against the practice, classifying it as a security risk among other concerns. [36]  ICANN\\'s Security and Stability Advisory Committee (SSAC) additionally claims that SMTP \"requires at least two labels in the FQDN of a mail address\" and, as such, mail servers would reject emails to addresses with dotless domains. [35] \\n ICANN has also published a resolution in 2013 that prohibits the creation of dotless domains on gTLDs. [37]  ccTLDs, however, fall largely under their respective country\\'s jurisdiction, and not under ICANN\\'s. Because of this, there have been many examples of dotless domains on ccTLDs in spite of ICANN\\'s vocal opposition.\\n As of September 2023, that is the case of:\\n  Anguilla\\'s .ai, online at http://ai./ (Archived 22 January 2023 at archive.today)It simply displays a notice that the website is no longer public.\\n Uzbekistan\\'s .uz, online at https://uz./ (Archived 4 September 2023 at archive.today)It\\'s a mirror of https://cctld.uz/, albeit with an invalid certificate. \\nOther ccTLDs with A or AAAA records, as of September 2023, include: .cm, .tk and .ws.\\n A similar query to org \\'s presented above can be made for ai, which shows A and MX records for the TLD:\\nQUESTION\\nai. IN ANY\\nANSWER\\nai. 21599 IN A 209.59.119.34\\nai. 21599 IN MX 10 mail.offshore.ai.\\nai. 21599 IN NS anycastdns1-cz.nic.ai.\\nai. 21599 IN NS anycastdns2-cz.nic.ai.\\nai. 21599 IN NS pch.whois.ai.\\n[…]\\nHistorically, many other ccTLDs have had A or AAAA records. On 3 September 2013, as reported by the IETF, they were the following: [38]  .ac, .dk, .gg, .io, .je, .kh, .sh, .tm, .to, and .vi.\\n New TLDs  [  edit  ]  \\nFollowing a 2014 resolution by ICANN, newly registered TLDs must implement the following A, MX, TXT, and SRV apex DNS records – where &lt;TLD&gt; stands for the registered TLD – for at least 90 days: [39] \\n&lt;TLD&gt;. 3600 IN MX 10 your-dns-needs-immediate-attention.&lt;TLD&gt;.\\n&lt;TLD&gt;. 3600 IN SRV 10 10 0 your-dns-needs-immediate-attention.&lt;TLD&gt;.\\n&lt;TLD&gt;. 3600 IN TXT \"Your DNS configuration needs immediate attention see https://icann.org/namecollision\"\\n&lt;TLD&gt;. 3600 IN A 127.0.53.53\\nThis requirement is meant to avoid domain name collisions when new TLDs are registered. For example, programmers may have used custom local domains such as foo.bar or test.dev, which would both collide with the creation of gTLDs .bar in 2014 and .dev in 2019. As of September 2023, the only top-level domains with these special apex records are .arab and .music.\\n While this does create apex DNS records of type A and MX, they do not qualify as a dotless domain, as the records should not point to real servers. For instance, the A record contains the IP 127.0.53.53, a loopback address (see IPv4 § Addressing), picked as a mnemonic to indicate a DNS-related problem, as DNS uses port 53. [40] \\n Pseudo-domains  [  edit  ]  \\nSeveral networks, such as BITNET, CSNET, and UUCP, existed that were in widespread use among computer professionals and academic users, but were not interoperable directly with the Internet and exchanged mail with the Internet via special email gateways. For relaying purposes on the gateways, messages associated with these networks were labeled with suffixes such as .bitnet, .oz, .csnet, or .uucp, but these domains did not exist as top-level domains in the public Domain Name System of the Internet.\\n Most of these networks have long since ceased to exist, and although UUCP still gets significant use in parts of the world where Internet infrastructure has not yet become well established, it subsequently transitioned to using Internet domain names, and pseudo-domains now largely survive as historical relics. One notable exception is the 2007 emergence of SWIFTNet Mail, which uses the swift pseudo-domain. [41] \\n The anonymity network Tor formerly used the top-level pseudo-domain .onion for onion services, which can only be reached with a Tor client because it uses the Tor onion routing protocol to reach the hidden service to protect the anonymity of users. However, the pseudo-domain became officially reserved in October 2015. i2p provides a similar hidden pseudo-domain, .i2p. And Namecoin uses the .bit pseudo-domain.\\n See also  [  edit  ]  \\n  Alternative DNS root \\n Domain hack \\n Domain name registrar \\n List of Internet top-level domains \\n Public Suffix List \\n Second-level domain  \\n References  [  edit  ]  \\n \\n   ^     \"Delegation Record for .ARPA\".

A top-level domain is the last level of every fully qualified domain name. They are called generic for historical reasons; initially, they were contrasted with country-specific TLDs in RFC 920.\\n The core group of generic top-level domains consists of the  com ,  net ,  org ,  biz , and  info  domains. In addition, the domains  name , and  pro  are also considered generic; however, these are designated as restricted, because registrations within them require proof of eligibility within the guidelines set for each.\\n Historically, the group of generic top-level domains included domains, created in the early development of the domain name system, that are now sponsored by designated agencies or organizations and are restricted to specific types of registrants. Thus, domains  edu ,  gov ,  int , and  mil  are now considered sponsored top-level domains, much like the themed top-level domains (e.g.,  jobs ). The entire group of domains that do not have a geographic or country designation (see country-code top-level domain) is still often referred to by the term generic TLDs.\\n The number of gTLD as of March 2018 exceeds 1,200 domains. [1]   [2] \\nTypes[edit]\\nOverall, IANA distinguishes the following groups of top-level domains: [3] \\n  infrastructure top-level domain (.arpa)\\ngeneric top-level domains (gTLD)\\nrestricted generic top-level domains (grTLD)\\n sponsored top-level domains (sTLD)\\n country code top-level domains (ccTLD)\\ninternationalized top-level domains (IDNs)\\n  internationalized country code top-level domains (IDN ccTLD)  \\n testing top-level domains (tTLD) \\nHistory[edit]\\nThe initial set of generic top-level domains, defined by RFC 920 in October 1984, was a set of \"general purpose domains\":  com ,  edu ,  gov ,  mil ,  org . The  net  domain was added with the first implementation of these domains. The com, net, and org TLDs, despite their originally specified goals, are now open to use for any purpose.\\n In November 1988, another TLD was introduced,  int . This TLD was introduced in response to NATO\\'s request for a domain name which adequately reflected its character as an international organization. It was also originally planned to be used for some Internet infrastructure databases, such as ip6.int, the IPv6 equivalent of in-addr.arpa. However, in May 2000, the Internet Architecture Board proposed to exclude infrastructure databases from the int domain. All new databases of this type would be created in  arpa  (a legacy domain from the conversion of ARPANET), and existing usage would move to arpa wherever feasible, which led to the use of ip6.arpa for IPv6 reverse lookups.\\n By the mid-1990s there was discussion of introduction of more TLDs. Jon Postel, as head of IANA, invited applications from interested parties. In early 1995, Postel created \"Draft Postel\", an Internet draft containing the procedures to create new domain name registries and new TLDs. [4]  Draft Postel created a number of small committees to approve the new TLDs. Because of the increasing interest, a number of large organizations took over the process under the Internet Society\\'s umbrella. This second attempt involved setting up a temporary organization called the International Ad Hoc Committee (IAHC). On February 4, 1997, the IAHC issued a report ignoring the Draft Postel recommendations and instead recommending the introduction of seven new TLDs (arts, firm, info, nom, rec, store, and web). However, these proposals were abandoned after the U.S. government intervened.[ citation needed ]\\n In September 1998, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) was created to take over the task of managing domain names. After a call for proposals (August 15, 2000) and a brief period of public consultation, ICANN announced on November 16, 2000 its selection of seven new TLDs:  aero ,  biz ,  coop ,  info ,  museum ,  name ,  pro .\\n   biz ,  info , and  museum  were activated in June 2001,  name  and  coop  in January 2002,  pro  in May 2002, and  aero  later in 2002.  pro  became a gTLD in May 2002, but did not become fully operational until June 2004.\\n ICANN added further TLDs, starting with a set of sponsored top-level domains. The application period for these was from December 15, 2003 to March 16, 2004; it resulted in ten applications. [5]  Of these, ICANN approved  asia ,  cat ,  jobs ,  mobi ,  tel  and  travel . In March 2011, xxx was approved [6]  (one year after an independent review found ICANN had broken its own bylaws by rejecting the application in 2007). [7]  Of the remaining applications ( post ,  mail  and an alternative tel proposal),  post  was introduced in 2012.\\n On June 26, 2008, during the 32nd International Public ICANN Meeting in Paris, [8]  ICANN started a new process of TLD naming policy to take a \"significant step forward on the introduction of new generic top-level domains.\" This program envisioned the availability of many new or']}},\n",
       " 'comprehensive_report': \"## Comprehensive Report: Edutech, GenAI, and Upskilling Opportunities\\n\\nThis report synthesizes information from multiple research reports to provide a comprehensive overview of the Edutech and GenAI market, focusing on education placements and upskilling opportunities in GenAI and image diffusion models.  The analysis highlights key trends, challenges, and strategic recommendations for stakeholders.\\n\\n\\n**I. Market Overview (2019-2024):**\\n\\nThe Edutech market, particularly the segment incorporating AI, has experienced exponential growth, significantly accelerating after the 2020 pandemic.  The emergence of GenAI in 2023 marked a major inflection point, revolutionizing possibilities for personalized learning, content creation, and assessment. While precise figures for the GenAI subset are unavailable, its rapid growth is undeniable, fueled by increased investment and significant funding rounds (e.g., Kyron Learning in 2023).  The market, initially fragmented, is undergoing consolidation through acquisitions, with larger players acquiring smaller startups. Government initiatives and industry collaborations are further driving AI adoption in education.\\n\\nImage diffusion models represent a newer application within the EdTech landscape, with potential for creating interactive visual learning materials and innovative assessment tools, although their current market penetration is limited.\\n\\n\\n**II.  Edutech Platform Functionalities:**\\n\\nEdutech platforms supporting education placements fall into two main categories:\\n\\n* **General K-12/Higher Ed Platforms:** These platforms (e.g., Blackbaud, PowerSchool, Canvas) primarily focus on Student Information Systems (SIS) and Learning Management Systems (LMS). While not directly managing placements, they provide crucial student data for placement programs.  Supplementary tools for literacy, behavior management, and skill assessment enhance learning but don't directly handle placements.\\n\\n* **Specialized Work Placement Systems:** These platforms (e.g., Handshake Students, CSM by Symplicity) act as intermediaries between students and employers, offering features like job listings, student-employer matching algorithms, and communication tools.  These systems are crucial for facilitating internships, co-ops, and work experience opportunities.\\n\\n\\n**III. Upskilling Programs in GenAI and Image Diffusion Models:**\\n\\nSpecific upskilling programs in Generative AI and image diffusion models require further research.  The available data doesn't list specific programs.  However, the high potential demand for such skills is evident, given the rapid growth of the GenAI market.

The provided text focuses on market data from 2023 onwards and later developments like ChatGPT.  Image diffusion models, a key aspect of the question, were also not as prominent in 2019 as they are now.  Therefore, a comprehensive analysis for 2019 requires extrapolating from later trends and acknowledging the limitations of available data.\\n\\n**Market Size and Growth (2019):**\\n\\n* **Limited Direct Data:** The provided text doesn't offer 2019 market size figures for the specific combination of edutech, GenAI upskilling, and image diffusion models.  The broader AI in education market was significantly smaller then, with estimates suggesting a value far less than the 2023 figure of USD 3.45 billion.\\n* **Extrapolation:** Based on the substantial CAGR (37.68% and 47.2% in different reports) reported for later years, we can infer that the 2019 market for AI in education, even excluding the niche areas of GenAI and image diffusion, was considerably smaller.  Growth was likely driven by increasing adoption of basic AI tools in education, like automated grading systems and personalized learning platforms.\\n* **Niche Market:**  In 2019, upskilling specifically in GenAI and image diffusion models was likely a nascent, very small niche within the broader AI education market.  These technologies were less mature and less widely understood.\\n\\n**Key Technological Developments (2019):**\\n\\n* **Early Stages of GenAI:** Generative AI models were in their early stages of development in 2019. While some foundational models existed, they weren't as sophisticated or accessible as those seen in 2023 and beyond.  Upskilling opportunities would have been limited and focused on fundamental AI concepts rather than specialized GenAI techniques.\\n* **Image Diffusion Models:** Image diffusion models were also less advanced in 2019.  While research was ongoing, their applications were not as widespread or mature as they became in subsequent years. Educational opportunities related to these models were minimal.\\n* **Other AI in Education:**  The focus was on more established AI applications in education like:\\n    * **Intelligent Tutoring Systems:** Providing personalized learning experiences.\\n    * **Automated Essay Scoring:** Automating grading tasks for teachers.\\n    * **Learning Analytics:** Using data to personalize learning paths.\\n\\n\\n**Major Market Events (2019):**\\n\\n* **Lack of Specific Data:**  The provided text lacks information on specific market events in 2019 directly related to the specified niche.\\n* **Broader AI Trends:**  General AI advancements and increased investment in AI research would have influenced the edutech sector indirectly.\\n\\n\\n**Investment Trends (2019):**\\n\\n* **Limited Investment in GenAI/Diffusion Models:**  Direct investment in edutech specifically focused on GenAI and image diffusion models would have been very low in 2019 due to the early stage of these technologies.\\n* **Increased Investment in AI in Education:**  Overall investment in AI in education was increasing, but the majority likely went towards more established applications of AI in education rather than the highly specialized areas mentioned in the question.\\n\\n\\n**Competitive Landscape Shifts (2019):**\\n\\n* **Consolidation Not Yet Prominent:**  The competitive landscape in 2019 was likely characterized by a larger number of smaller players.  Major mergers and acquisitions in the specialized areas of GenAI and image diffusion in edutech were unlikely to have occurred.\\n* **Emerging Players:**  Companies focusing on fundamental AI applications in education were establishing themselves.  Those specializing in the advanced areas were likely just beginning to emerge.\\n\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\n\\nData directly addressing the market question for 2019 is scarce. The market for education placements, upskilling in GenAI and image diffusion models was extremely small in 2019.  The broader AI in education market was growing, but the focus was on more established technologies. The subsequent years witnessed explosive growth in GenAI and diffusion models, creating a much larger and more active market.  To get a more complete picture of the 2019 landscape, one would need to consult specialized market research reports from that period or conduct primary research with key players active in the field.\\n\"\n",

Primary education platforms are far less likely to overlap with higher ed products.\\nTypes of K-12 Online Learning Platforms\\nThere are several standard areas of online learning platforms for K-12 schools. Many education tech vendors offer one or multiple products to serve schools\\u2019 needs across multiple areas simultaneously. Others specialize as point solutions and rely on integrating with other vendor\\u2019s offerings.\\nThe \\u201ccore\\u201d platform for schools is usually their Student Management System, also known as a Student Information System. These systems are the central repository for student data, including class schedules, student enrollment information and personal data, and provide students, parents, and staff access to this data.\\nSchool Management Software is more focused on serving the administrative side of K-12 schools. It is also called \\u201cSchool Administration Software\\u201d for the same reason. These systems help staff manage or automate administrative tasks around admissions, scheduling, billing, internal and external communication, and other tasks.\\nK-12 Learning Management Systems focus on the teacher, student, and classroom experience. They specialize in helping teachers create and manage course materials, often including assessment management. LMSs also allow students and parents/guardians to track students\\u2019 academic performance. In contrast with Higher Education LMSs, K-12 focused products will often offer more features to facilitate in-classroom learning and engagement.\\nK-12 Online Learning Platform Comparison\\nWhen comparing different K-12 online learning platforms, consider these factors:\\n Centralized Platform vs. Point Solution: Does each product provide a one-stop-shop for multiple functions a school needs, such as SIS and LMS capabilities? If it does not, how well does each point solution integrate with the other systems that the school or district uses? Comparing products\\u2019 scopes will help buyers understand the total investment needed to support a K-12 institution and what IT management or maintenance may be required to support multiple systems in the long term.\\n In-Person vs. Remote Learning: For primary education platforms in particular, are there features tailored to the school\\u2019s learning environment, whether that is in-person or remote learning? Many products serving younger learners have built out more robust classroom support features of in-person learning, but they may be less helpful or unusable in a remote context. This can leave schools paying for unused features.\\n Pricing: School budgets for education technology can be a substantial limiting factor that varies from district to district. When comparing products, consider the total cost of outfitting a school or district with the necessary education tech, including SMS, LMS, and other needed administrative functions. Evaluating the entire package holistically can help education buyers find the ideal platform deployment to meet their needs.\\nPricing Information\\nPer-student or per-school pricing, usually billed monthly or annually. Individual products can start a $2-10/student/month, but will vary based on volume and how comprehensive a particular product is. More comprehensive products are likely to cost more, but will limit the total number of systems that schools must purchase.\\n  Frequently Asked Questions     What do K-12 online learning platforms do?    K-12 online learning platforms facilitate the administration of K-12 academic institutions and support staff and student management of students\\u2019 data.      Who uses K-12 online learning platforms?    K-12 online learning platforms are most heavily used by school staff, such as teachers and administrators.      What\\u2019s the difference between K-12 and Higher Education technology?    K-12 online learning platforms will offer more features for parents and guardians to participate in their student\\u2019s education and will offer features tailored to younger audiences.      How much do K-12 online learning platforms cost?    Pricing can start as low as $2/student/month, but can scale up beyond $10/student/month for more comprehensive platforms and features.\",\n",
      "        \"Although considered a relatively new category in the educational IT world, the work placement systems rely on the old employment agency model. These solutions aim to build relationships between students and employers in a one-stop-shop environment to offer job opportunities.\\nDefinition of a Work Placement System\\nWe could define a work placement system as a tool that offers job opportunities to students. In reality, it is a bit more complex than that. Some solutions focus on internships in the medical field (MD, nursing), while others concentrate on cooperative education, but overall, work placement tools in educational institutions are designed to complement the academic path taken by students.\\nSolutions in this product group may include many experiential learning opportunities: curriculum placement, clinical placement, work experience, internships, industry projects, volunteering, graduate placements and international opportunities. \\nWork placement systems are not career readiness solutions. While career readiness systems aim to equip students with soft skills to succeed in the job market, work placement systems act as a liaison between students and employers.\\nHistory of Cooperative Education and Work Placement Solutions\\nThe work-based learning is not a new concept. Herman Schneider developed the concept of cooperative education when he founded the first co-op program at the University of Cincinnati in 1906. Other universities in North America formalized cooperative education as early as 1910. At first, it was all about engineering (mainly mechanical and automotive), but it later expanded to liberal arts and business. \\nEven if cooperative education is a century-old concept, work placement solutions only emerged at the end of the 20th century in North America. In the US, Symplicity (1996) was one of the first solutions accessible to universities and colleges. Orbis (now part of Symplicity) gained its first contracts in 2002 on the Canadian market. ARC Technologies (1990), a UK company, is probably the first company to have offered work placement solutions to institutions in Europe. However, it is unclear if it offered work placement solutions at its inception.\\nAt first, work placement systems were somewhat an electronic version of the bulletin board with coop and internship placement postings. Some solutions included the matching component with a ranking system in place. We had to wait for the early 2010s to see a massive expansion in this product category. As of 2022, ListedTech tracks twenty products in this product category.\\nMarket Leaders\\n \\nThe work placement category is still growing. Even though we have 2,500 implementations in our database, we consider our data to be preliminary. Within our dataset, the market leaders are Handshake Students, CSM by Symplicity and ACEMAPP Education. Please note that this preliminary data represent implementations in higher education institutions worldwide.\\n \\nWe are in the final phase of releasing our data. Before doing so, we always validate our information with a company that works in the field. If you would like to help, send us an email.\"\n",

      "        \"If you are coming up short on results, there are a a few strategies that may help expand your search.\\n1. Harvest Additional Synonyms\\nSurvey your initial search results to identify any additional keywords or synonyms that might broaden the search. Consider acronyms, spelling variants and alternative phrases and integrate them into the search with the Boolean operator OR. \\nIntegrating synonyms with the Boolean operator OR will typically increase the number of search results\\n Search Query \\n Results \\ncontraception AND Obamacare\\n91\\ncontraception AND (Obamacare OR \\\"Affordable Care Act\\\" OR ACA OR \\\"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\\\" OR PPACA)\\n219\\n2. \\\"Explode\\\" Your Subject Headings\\n\\\"Exploding\\\" a subject heading means asking the database to retrieve articles with that subject heading, as well as articles that have been tagged with terms that are under that term in the subject heading tree. For instance, in CINAHL, exploding the term \\\"Telehealth\\\" would include narrower terms like \\\"Telemedicine\\\" and \\\"Telenursing\\\".\\n \\nSearching with a subject heading exploded retrieves a greater number of results\\n Search Query \\n Results \\n(MH \\\"Telehealth\\\") \\n9,500\\n(MH \\\"Telehealth+\\\") \\n26,000\\nPubMed automatically explodes MeSH terms to include narrower subject headings.\\nAlso see:\\nEBSCOConnect : \\\"In a Thesaurus or MeSH search in EBSCOhost, what does it mean to explode a term?\\\" \\n3. Truncate One or More Search Term\\nTruncation symbols in a database (such as \\\"*\\\" or \\\"?\\\") allow you to search on a root word and include plurals or variants.\\nFor example:\\n diabet* retrieves diabetes OR diabetic OR diabetogenic \\n autis* retrieves autism OR autistic \\n nurs* retrieves nurse OR nursing OR nursing \\nBe aware that truncation may also retrieve false hits. For instance, a search on nurs* would also retrieve \\u201cnursery school\\u201d. Using a shorter root word will likely map to more variants, while using a longer root word will be more specific. \\n4. Snowballing / Pearl Growing\\n\\\"Citation pearl growing\\\" uses a relevant source to lead to more sources on a topic. In the database records, look for link to \\\"related\\\" articles or \\u201cfind similar results.\\\" \\nAlso consider mining the reference list to follow up on citations that may be relevant. Review articles, including systematic reviews, can be a goldmine of related literature. \\nSimilarly, you can perform 'cited reference searching' to track additional articles that have cited a particular, relevant study. \\n \\nFinally, if you find that much of the relevant literature on your topic of interest is published in a small handful of journals, you could also \\\"hand search\\\" the tables of content for those journals by accessing them through the library catalog.\"\n",

Search operators can be useful for everything from content research to technical SEO audits.\\nHow do I use search operators?\\nYou can enter search operators directly into the Google search box, just as you would a text search:\\n \\nExcept in special cases (such as the \\u201cin\\u201d operator), Google will return standard organic results.\\nGoogle search operators cheat sheet\\nYou can find all of the major organic search operators below, broken up into three categories: \\u201cBasic\\u201d, \\u201cAdvanced\\u201d, and \\u201cUnreliable\\u201d. Basic search operators are operators that modify standard text searches.\\n   I. Basic search operators     \\\" \\\"   \\\"nikola tesla\\\"  Put any phrase in quotes to force Google to use exact-match. On single words, prevents synonyms.   OR   tesla OR edison  Google search defaults to logical AND between terms. Specify \\\"OR\\\" for a logical OR (ALL-CAPS).   |   tesla | edison  The pipe (|) operator is identical to \\\"OR\\\". Useful if your Caps-lock is broken :)   ( )   (tesla OR edison) alternating current  Use parentheses to group operators and control the order in which they execute.   -   tesla -motors  Put minus (-) in front of any term (including operators) to exclude that term from the results.   *   tesla \\\"rock * roll\\\"  An asterisk (*) acts as a wild-card and will match on any word.   #..#   tesla announcement 2015..2017  Use (..) with numbers on either side to match on any integer in that range of numbers.   $   tesla deposit $1000  Search prices with the dollar sign ($). You can combine ($) and (.) for exact prices, like $19.99.   \\u20ac   \\u20ac9,99 lunch deals  Search prices with the Euro sign (\\u20ac). Most other currency signs don't seem to be honored by Google.    in   250 kph in mph  Use \\\"in\\\" to convert between two equivalent units. This returns a special, Knowledge Card style result.   \\nAdvanced search operators are special commands that modify searches and may require additional parameters (such as a domain name). Advanced operators are typically used to narrow searches and drill deeper into results.\\n   II. Advanced search operators     intitle:   intitle:\\\"tesla vs edison\\\"  Search only in the page's title for a word or phrase. Use exact-match (quotes) for phrases.   allintitle:   allintitle: tesla vs edison  Search the page title for every individual term following \\\"allintitle:\\\". Same as multiple intitle:'s.   inurl:   tesla announcements inurl:2016  Look for a word or phrase (in quotes) in the document URL. Can combine with other terms.   allinurl:   allinurl: amazon field-keywords nikon  Search the URL for every individual term following \\\"allinurl:\\\". Same as multiple inurl:'s.   intext:   intext:\\\"orbi vs eero vs google wifi\\\"  Search for a word or phrase (in quotes), but only in the body/document text.   allintext:   allintext: orbi eero google wifi  Search the body text for every individual term following \\\"allintext:\\\". Same as multiple intexts:'s.   filetype:   \\\"tesla announcements\\\" filetype:pdf  Match only a specific file type. Some examples include PDF, DOC, XLS, PPT, and TXT.   related:   related:nytimes.com  Return sites that are related to a target domain. Only works for larger domains.   AROUND(X)   tesla AROUND(3) edison  Returns results where the two terms/phrases are within (X) words of each other.   \\nUnreliable operators have either been found to produce inconsistent results or have been deprecated altogether. The \\\"link:\\\" operator was officially deprecated in early 2017. It appears that \\\"inanchor:\\\" operators are still in use, but return very narrow and sometimes unreliable results. Use link-based operators only for initial research.\\n   III. Unreliable/deprecated operators     ~   ~cars  Include synonyms. Seems to be unreliable, and synonym inclusion is default now.   +   +cars  Force exact-match on a single phrase. Deprecated with the launch of Google+.   daterange:   tesla announcements daterange:2457663-2457754  Return results in the specified range. Can be inconsistent. Requires Julian dates.   link:   link:nytimes.com  Find pages that link to the target domain. This operator was deprecated in early 2017.   inanchor:   inanchor:\\\"tesla announcements\\\"  Find pages linked to with the specified anchor text/phrase. Data is heavily sampled.   allinanchor:   allinanchor: tesla announcements  Find pages with all individual terms after \\\"inanchor:\\\" in the inbound anchor text.   \\nNote that, for all of the \\\"allin...:\\\" operators, Google will try to apply the operator to every term following it. Combining \\\"allin...:\\\" operators with any other operators will almost never produce the desired results.\\nSearch operator tips &amp; tricks\\nHaving all of the pieces is only the first step in building a puzzle. The real power of search operators comes from combining them.\\n1. Chain together operator combos\\nYou can chain together almost any combination of text searches, basic operators, and advanced operators:\\n\\\"nikola tesla\\\" intitle:\\\"top 5..10 facts\\\" -site:youtube.com inurl:2015\\nThis search returns any pages that mention \\\"Nikola Tesla\\\" (exact-match), have the phrase \\\"Top (X) facts\\\" in the title, where X ranges from 5 to 10, are not on YouTube.com, and have \\\"2015\\\" somewhere in the URL.\\n2. Hunt down plagiarized content\\nTrying to find out if your content is unique or if someone is plagiarizing you? Use a unique phrase from your text, put it in quotes (exact-match) after an \\\"intext:\\\" operator, and exclude your own site with \\\"-site:\\\"...\\nintext:\\\"they were frolicking in our entrails\\\" -site:moz.com\\nSimilarly, you can use \\\"intitle:\\\" with a long, exact-match phrase to find duplicate copies of your content.\\n3. Audit your HTTP-&gt;HTTPS transition\\nSwitching a site from HTTP to HTTPS can be challenging. Double-check your progress by seeing how many of each type of page Google has indexed. Use the \\\"site:\\\" operator on your root domain and then exclude HTTPS pages with \\\"-inurl:\\\"...\\nsite:moz.com -inurl:https\\nThis will help you track down any stragglers or find pages that might not have been re-crawled by Google.\\nThese are just a few examples of a nearly infinite set of combinations. Looking for more examples? You're in luck! We've created a mega-list of 67 examples to catapult you toward site operator mastery.\\nRise in the rankings with Moz Pro\\nWith top-notch link and keyword data and in-depth analytics, Moz Pro provides the tracking and insights you need to reach #1.

This ultimate guide contains all of Google's search string parameters. you can also build your own advanced search using google's advanced search form.\\nhttp://www.google.com/search?\\nGoogle's URL. You'll see it if you look at the address bar, or Chrome omnibar.\\nq=query+goes+here\\nThe query string. Words are separated by + signs.\\nEverything from here on in is preceded by an &amp; sign, as it's tagged on to the end. Here's where things get interesting...\\n 1. Exact match query \\nas_epq=query+goes+here\\nResults must include the query, in the word order displayed.\\n Shows as \\\"query goes here\\\" \\n    2. Advanced \\\"Or\\\" filter  \\nas_oq=\\\"query+string\\\"+goes+here\\nResults must include one or more of the words in this string. \\nBasically, it's like a more advanced version of the one above, using an \\\"or\\\" filter. Thus, every result must have the main initial query, and one or more of the sets of terms in these strings.\\n Shows as \\\"query string\\\" OR goes OR here     3. Negative Keywords  \\nas_eq=don't+include+these+words\\nResults must NOT include any words in this string.\\n Shows as -don't -include -these -words \\n 4. Limit the number of results  \\nnum=xx\\nControls the number of results shown. \\nMust be a numeric value, and can be anything up to 100. Doesn't work with fractions.\\n 5. Filetype match \\nas_filetype=extension\\nOnly returns results that end in .extension. Currently supports any input. Try it - make a file with a random extension, get it indexed and do a search. Also shows that as long as it validates to something.\\n Shows as filetype:extension \\n 6. Limit results to one site  \\nas_sitesearch=example.com\\nLimits results to just the site you choose.\\n Shows as site:example.com \\n 7. Find results from specific dates   \\nas_qdr=x\\nSwap out x for the following to limit the search to only files first indexed in:\\n d - the previous 24 hours w - the previous seven days m - the previous month y - past year mn - the previous n number of months. So m2 would be the previous two, m3 would be three, and so on. Does work into double digits \\n 8. Find pages with specific usage rights \\nas_rights=xxx\\nLimits the search to files/pages that have certain rights. The options are:\\n (cc_publicdomain|cc_attribute|cc_sharealike|cc_noncommercial|cc_nonderived) - free to use or share (cc_publicdomain|cc_attribute|cc_sharealike|cc_nonderived).-(cc_noncommercial) - free to use or share, including commercially (cc_publicdomain|cc_attribute|cc_sharealike|cc_noncommercial).-(cc_nonderived) - free to use, share, or modify (cc_publicdomain|cc_attribute|cc_sharealike).-(cc_noncommercial|cc_nonderived) - free to use, share, or modify commercially \\nIf you want to make up your own, put the bits you want in brackets, separated by pipe characters (|), and exclude the bits you don't by putting them in brackets, preceded by .- and again pipe-separated.\\n 9. Do an allintitle search as a query string \\nallintitle%3Asearch+terms\\nThis is actually appended to the q= parameter, hence a search for fishing with the allintitle term \\\"sea bass\\\" would require the following query:\\nq=fishing+allintitle%3Asea+bass\\n Shows as allintitle:search terms \\nN.B. This also works with allintext to search page body text, allinurl for searching the URL, and allinanchor for finding sites that are linked to with certain anchor text.   \\n 10. Find products in a specific price range \\nnnn..yyyy\\nLike the allin parameters, this is actually appended to the q= parameter. What this does though is let you search for results between numeric ranges. For example, if you wanted to find documents with numbers between 15 and 100, you'd put in 15..100. Very useful for finding products in a price range, when combined with the site limiter. Works with $, \\u00a3, and other such things.\\n Shows as query 15..100 \\n 11. Do + searches as a query string  \\n%2Bterm\\nAgain, this is appended to the q= parameter. The %2B is actually the + sign encoded, and will return results featuring only the term used, with no pluralisations, alternate tenses, or synonyms.\\n Shows as +term \\n        12. Find results for your search term, and synonyms    \\n~term\\nAnother one that's appended to the q= parameter. Returns results for the term used and synonyms.\\n Shows as ~term \\n      13. Find definitions for your search term    \\ndefine%3Aword\\nYet another q= parameter add-on. Returns definitions for the word you put in.\\n Shows as define:word \\n 14. Find results for two words that can have other words in between  \\nterm * term two\\nAnd another q= parameter add-on. Returns results with listings that contain both words, with other words between them.\\n 15. Use Google's calculator via query string \\nn+n2, n-n2, n/n2, n*n2, n^n2 and n% of n2\\nGoogle's calculator functions. They are, in order, add, subtract, divide, multiply, raise to the power of, and return x percentage of.\\n 16. Modify safe search \\nsafe=active\\nSets safe search to on. To turn it off, change active to images.\\n 17. Find similar sites \\nas_rq=example.com\\nFinds sites Google thinks are related to the URL you put in.\\n Shows as query related:example.com \\n   18. View a site's backlinks  \\nas_lq=example.com\\nFinds sites that link to the URL you put in.\\n Shows as query link:example.com \\n 19. Open a new window  \\nnewwindow=n\\nOpens clicked listings in a new window. Very useful for opening lots of documents at a time, for competitor research. Set to 1 to activate, and 0 to turn it off.\\n 20  . Modify personalized search  \\npws\\nControls whether personalised search is on or not. Set to 1 to activate, and 0 to turn it off.\\n 21 . Stop Adwords from collecting data \\nadtest=on\\nTurns off AdWords database connection, so your browsing won't show up as an impression, and will disable the URLs. Set to on to activate, and off to turn it off.\\n 22 . Simulate a button click \\nbtnG=Search\\nSimulates a click on the normal Google results buttom. Change to btnI to get the I'm Feeling Lucky button result.\\n 23 . Change input encoding settings \\nie=\\nControls the input encoding settings. This defaults to UTF-8, and is worked out server-side, hence changing it doesn't do anything.\\n 24 . Change output encoding settings \\noe=\\nControls the output encoding settings. Works in the same way as ie, so you can tinker away, but it won't do anything.\\n 25 . Change language \\n&amp;hl=value\\nChanges the interface language. I won't list them all here, but you can find them all here. \\n 26 . Limit languages \\nlr=value\\nLimits the languages used to return results. Not hugely effective. That said, here's the list of all of them:\\n lang_ar - Arabic lang_hy - Armenian lang_be - Belarusian lang_bg - Bulgarian lang_ca - Catalan lang_hr - Croatian lang_cs - Czech lang_da - Danish lang_nl - Dutch lang_en - English lang_eo - Esperanto lang_et - Estonian lang_tl - Filipino lang_fi - Finnish lang_fr - French lang_de - German lang_el - Greek lang_iw - Hebrew lang_hu - Hungarian lang_is - Icelandic lang_id - Indonesian lang_it - Italian lang_ja - Japanese lang_ko - Korean lang_lv - Latvian lang_lt - Lithuanian lang_no - Norwegian lang_fa - Persian lang_pl - Polish lang_pt - Portuguese lang_ro - Romanian lang_ru - Russian lang_sr - Serbian lang_sk - Slovak lang_sl - Slovenian lang_es - Spanish lang_sv - Swedish lang_th - Thai lang_tr - Turkish lang_uk - Ukrainian lang_vi - Vietnamese lang_zh-CN - Chinese Simplified lang_zh-TW - Chinese Traditional \\n 27 .

[9]  The top-level domain names are installed in the root zone of the name space. For all domains in lower levels, it is the last part of the domain name, that is, the last non-empty label of a fully qualified domain name. For example, in the domain name www.example.com, the top-level domain is .com. Responsibility for management of most top-level domains is delegated to specific organizations by the ICANN, an Internet multi-stakeholder community, which operates the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), and is in charge of maintaining the DNS root zone.\\n History  [  edit  ]  \\nOriginally, the top-level domain space was organized into three main groups: Countries, Categories, and Multiorganizations. [10]  An additional temporary group consisted of only the initial DNS domain, .arpa, [11]  and was intended for transitional purposes toward the stabilization of the domain name system.\\n Types  [  edit  ]  \\nAs of 2015, IANA distinguishes the following groups of top-level domains: [12] \\n  Infrastructure top-level domain (ARPA): This group consists of one domain, the Address and Routing Parameter Area. It is managed by IANA on behalf of the Internet Engineering Task Force for various purposes specified in the Request for Comments publications.\\n Generic top-level domains (gTLD): Top-level domains with three or more characters\\nGeneric restricted top-level domains (grTLD): These domains are managed under official ICANN-accredited registrars.\\n Sponsored top-level domains (sTLD): These domains are proposed and sponsored by private agencies or organizations that establish and enforce rules restricting the eligibility to use the TLD. Use is based on community theme concepts; these domains are managed under official ICANN accredited registrars.\\n country-code top-level domains (ccTLD): Two-letter domains established for countries or territories. With some historical exceptions, the code for any territory is the same as its two-letter ISO 3166 code.\\n  Internationalized country code top-level domains (IDN ccTLD): ccTLDs in non-Latin character sets (e.g., Arabic, Cyrillic, Greek, Hebrew, or Chinese).  \\n Test top-level domains (tTLD): These domains were installed under .test for testing purposes in the IDN development process; these domains are not present in the root zone. \\nCountries are designated in the Domain Name System by their two-letter ISO country code; [13]  there are exceptions, however (e.g., .uk). This group of domains is, therefore, commonly known as country-code top-level domains (ccTLD). Since 2009, countries with non\\u2013Latin-based scripts may apply for internationalized country code top-level domain names, which are displayed in end-user applications in their language-native script or alphabet, but use a Punycode-translated ASCII domain name in the Domain Name System.\\n Generic top-level domains (formerly categories) initially consisted of .gov, .edu, .com, .mil, .org, and .net. More generic TLDs have been added, such as .info.\\n The authoritative list of current TLDs in the root zone is published at the IANA website at https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db/.\\n Internationalized country code TLDs  [  edit  ]  \\nAn internationalized country code top-level domain (IDN ccTLD) is a top-level domain with a specially encoded domain name that is displayed in an end-user application, such as a web browser, in its language-native script or alphabet (such as the Arabic alphabet), or a non-alphabetic writing system (such as Chinese characters). IDN ccTLDs are an application of the internationalized domain name (IDN) system to top-level Internet domains assigned to countries, or independent geographic regions.\\n ICANN started to accept applications for IDN ccTLDs in November 2009, [14]  and installed the first set into the Domain Names System in May 2010. The first set was a group of Arabic names for the countries of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. By May 2010, 21 countries had submitted applications to ICANN, representing 11 scripts. [15] \\n Infrastructure domain  [  edit  ]  \\nThe domain .arpa was the first Internet top-level domain. It was intended to be used only temporarily, aiding in the transition of traditional ARPANET host names to the domain name system. However, after it had been used for reverse DNS lookup, it was found impractical to retire it, and is used today exclusively for Internet infrastructure purposes such as in-addr.arpa for IPv4 and ip6.arpa for IPv6 reverse DNS resolution, uri.arpa and urn.arpa for the Dynamic Delegation Discovery System, and e164.arpa for telephone number mapping based on NAPTR DNS records. For historical reasons, .arpa is sometimes considered to be a generic top-level domain. [16] \\n Reserved domains  [  edit  ]  \\nA set of domain names is reserved [17]   [18]  by the Internet Engineering Task Force as special-use domain names per authority of Request for Comments (RFC) 6761. The practice originated in RFC 1597 for reserved address allocations in 1994, and reserved top-level domains in RFC 2606 of 1999. RFC 6761 reserves the following four top-level domain names to avoid confusion and conflict. [19]  Any such reserved usage of those TLDs should not occur in production networks that utilize the global domain name system:\\n  .example \\u2013 reserved for use in examples\\n .invalid \\u2013 reserved for use in invalid domain names\\n .localhost \\u2013 reserved to avoid conflict with the traditional use of localhost as a hostname\\n .test \\u2013 reserved for use in tests \\nRFC 6762 reserves the use of .local for link-local host names that can be resolved via the multicast DNS name resolution protocol. [20] \\n RFC 7686 reserves the use of .onion for the self-authenticating names of Tor onion services. These names can only be resolved by a Tor client because of the use of onion routing to protect the anonymity of users. [21] \\n ICANN proposed the use of .internal on 2024-01-24 [22]  with request for feedback. In 2017 an Internet-Draft draft-wkumari-dnsop-internal-00 already proposed reserving the use of .internal for \\\"names which do not have meaning in the global context but do have meaning in a context internal to their network\\\", and for which the RFC 6761 reserved names are semantically inappropriate.\\n Historical domains  [  edit  ]  \\nIn the late 1980s, InterNIC created the .nato domain for use by NATO.[  citation needed  ] NATO considered none of the then-existing TLDs as adequately reflecting their status as an international organization. Soon after this addition, however, InterNIC also created the .int TLD for the use by international organizations in general, and persuaded NATO to use the second level domain nato.int instead. The nato TLD, no longer used, was finally removed in July 1996.[  citation needed  ]\\n Other historical TLDs are .cs for Czechoslovakia (now using .cz for Czech Republic and .sk for Slovakia), .dd for East Germany (using .de after reunification of Germany), .yu for SFR Yugoslavia and Serbia and Montenegro (now using .ba for Bosnia and Herzegovina, .hr for Croatia, .me for Montenegro, .mk for North Macedonia, .rs for Serbia and .si for Slovenia), .zr for Zaire (now .cd for the Democratic Republic of the Congo), and .an for Netherlands Antilles (now .aw for Aruba, .cw for Cura\\u00e7ao and .sx for Sint Maarten). In contrast to these, the TLD .su has remained active despite the demise of the Soviet Union that it represents. Under the chairmanship of Nigel Roberts, ICANN's ccNSO is working on a policy for the retirement of ccTLDs that have been removed from ISO 3166.\\n Proposed domains  [  edit  ]  \\nAround late 2000, ICANN discussed and finally introduced [23]  .aero, .biz, .coop, .info, .museum, .name, and .pro TLDs. Site owners argued that a similar TLD should be made available for adult and pornographic websites to settle the dispute of obscene content on the Internet, to address the responsibility of US service providers under the US Communications Decency Act of 1996. Several options were proposed including xxx, sex and adult. [24]  The .xxx top-level domain eventually went live in 2011. [25] \\n An older proposal consisted of seven new gTLDs: arts, firm, .info, nom, rec, .shop, and .web. [26]  Later .biz, .info, .museum, and .name covered most of these old proposals.\\n During the 32nd International Public ICANN Meeting in Paris in 2008, ICANN started a new process of TLD naming policy to take a \\\"significant step forward on the introduction of new generic top-level domains\\\". [27]  This program envisioned the availability of many new or already proposed domains, as well as a new application and implementation process. [28]  Observers believed that the new rules could result in hundreds of new gTLDs being registered. [29] \\n On 13 June 2012, ICANN announced nearly 2,000 applications for top-level domains, which began installation throughout 2013. [30]   [31]  The first seven \\u2013 bike, clothing, guru, holdings, plumbing, singles, and ventures \\u2013 were released in 2014. [32] \\n Rejected domains  [  edit  ]  \\nICANN rejected several proposed domains to include .home and .corp due to conflicts regarding gTLDs that are in use in internal networks.\\n Investigation into the conflicts was conducted at ICANN's request by Interisle Consulting. The resulting report was to become known as the Name Collision [33]  issue, which was first reported at ICANN 47. [34] \\n Dotless domains  [  edit  ]  \\n     .org[.] is a node in the DNS tree, just like wikipedia.[org.] and en.[wikipedia.org.]. As such, it has its own DNS records. \\nDue to the structure of DNS, each node in the tree has its own collection of records, and since top-level domains are nodes in DNS, they have records of their own. For example, querying org itself (with a tool such as dig, host, or nslookup) returns information on its nameservers:\\nQUESTION\\norg. IN ANY\\nANSWER\\norg. 21599 IN NS a0.org.afilias-nst.info.\\norg. 21599 IN NS a2.org.afilias-nst.info.\\norg. 21599 IN NS b0.org.afilias-nst.org.\\norg. 21599 IN NS b2.org.afilias-nst.org.\\n[\\u2026]\\n Dotless domains are top-level domains that take advantage of that fact, and implement A, AAAA or MX DNS records to serve webpages or allow incoming email directly on a TLD \\u2013 for example, a webpage hosted on http://example/, or an email address user@example. [35] \\n  ICANN and IAB have spoken out against the practice, classifying it as a security risk among other concerns. [36]  ICANN's Security and Stability Advisory Committee (SSAC) additionally claims that SMTP \\\"requires at least two labels in the FQDN of a mail address\\\" and, as such, mail servers would reject emails to addresses with dotless domains. [35] \\n ICANN has also published a resolution in 2013 that prohibits the creation of dotless domains on gTLDs. [37]  ccTLDs, however, fall largely under their respective country's jurisdiction, and not under ICANN's. Because of this, there have been many examples of dotless domains on ccTLDs in spite of ICANN's vocal opposition.\\n As of September 2023, that is the case of:\\n  Anguilla's .ai, online at http://ai./ (Archived 22 January 2023 at archive.today)It simply displays a notice that the website is no longer public.\\n Uzbekistan's .uz, online at https://uz./ (Archived 4 September 2023 at archive.today)It's a mirror of https://cctld.uz/, albeit with an invalid certificate. \\nOther ccTLDs with A or AAAA records, as of September 2023, include: .cm, .tk and .ws.\\n A similar query to org 's presented above can be made for ai, which shows A and MX records for the TLD:\\nQUESTION\\nai. IN ANY\\nANSWER\\nai. 21599 IN A 209.59.119.34\\nai. 21599 IN MX 10 mail.offshore.ai.\\nai. 21599 IN NS anycastdns1-cz.nic.ai.\\nai. 21599 IN NS anycastdns2-cz.nic.ai.\\nai. 21599 IN NS pch.whois.ai.\\n[\\u2026]\\nHistorically, many other ccTLDs have had A or AAAA records. On 3 September 2013, as reported by the IETF, they were the following: [38]  .ac, .dk, .gg, .io, .je, .kh, .sh, .tm, .to, and .vi.\\n New TLDs  [  edit  ]  \\nFollowing a 2014 resolution by ICANN, newly registered TLDs must implement the following A, MX, TXT, and SRV apex DNS records \\u2013 where &lt;TLD&gt; stands for the registered TLD \\u2013 for at least 90 days: [39] \\n&lt;TLD&gt;. 3600 IN MX 10 your-dns-needs-immediate-attention.&lt;TLD&gt;.\\n&lt;TLD&gt;. 3600 IN SRV 10 10 0 your-dns-needs-immediate-attention.&lt;TLD&gt;.\\n&lt;TLD&gt;. 3600 IN TXT \\\"Your DNS configuration needs immediate attention see https://icann.org/namecollision\\\"\\n&lt;TLD&gt;. 3600 IN A 127.0.53.53\\nThis requirement is meant to avoid domain name collisions when new TLDs are registered. For example, programmers may have used custom local domains such as foo.bar or test.dev, which would both collide with the creation of gTLDs .bar in 2014 and .dev in 2019. As of September 2023, the only top-level domains with these special apex records are .arab and .music.\\n While this does create apex DNS records of type A and MX, they do not qualify as a dotless domain, as the records should not point to real servers. For instance, the A record contains the IP 127.0.53.53, a loopback address (see IPv4 \\u00a7 Addressing), picked as a mnemonic to indicate a DNS-related problem, as DNS uses port 53. [40] \\n Pseudo-domains  [  edit  ]  \\nSeveral networks, such as BITNET, CSNET, and UUCP, existed that were in widespread use among computer professionals and academic users, but were not interoperable directly with the Internet and exchanged mail with the Internet via special email gateways. For relaying purposes on the gateways, messages associated with these networks were labeled with suffixes such as .bitnet, .oz, .csnet, or .uucp, but these domains did not exist as top-level domains in the public Domain Name System of the Internet.\\n Most of these networks have long since ceased to exist, and although UUCP still gets significant use in parts of the world where Internet infrastructure has not yet become well established, it subsequently transitioned to using Internet domain names, and pseudo-domains now largely survive as historical relics. One notable exception is the 2007 emergence of SWIFTNet Mail, which uses the swift pseudo-domain. [41] \\n The anonymity network Tor formerly used the top-level pseudo-domain .onion for onion services, which can only be reached with a Tor client because it uses the Tor onion routing protocol to reach the hidden service to protect the anonymity of users. However, the pseudo-domain became officially reserved in October 2015. i2p provides a similar hidden pseudo-domain, .i2p. And Namecoin uses the .bit pseudo-domain.\\n See also  [  edit  ]  \\n  Alternative DNS root \\n Domain hack \\n Domain name registrar \\n List of Internet top-level domains \\n Public Suffix List \\n Second-level domain  \\n References  [  edit  ]  \\n \\n   ^     \\\"Delegation Record for .ARPA\\\".

A top-level domain is the last level of every fully qualified domain name. They are called generic for historical reasons; initially, they were contrasted with country-specific TLDs in RFC 920.\\n The core group of generic top-level domains consists of the  com ,  net ,  org ,  biz , and  info  domains. In addition, the domains  name , and  pro  are also considered generic; however, these are designated as restricted, because registrations within them require proof of eligibility within the guidelines set for each.\\n Historically, the group of generic top-level domains included domains, created in the early development of the domain name system, that are now sponsored by designated agencies or organizations and are restricted to specific types of registrants. Thus, domains  edu ,  gov ,  int , and  mil  are now considered sponsored top-level domains, much like the themed top-level domains (e.g.,  jobs ). The entire group of domains that do not have a geographic or country designation (see country-code top-level domain) is still often referred to by the term generic TLDs.\\n The number of gTLD as of March 2018 exceeds 1,200 domains. [1]   [2] \\nTypes[edit]\\nOverall, IANA distinguishes the following groups of top-level domains: [3] \\n  infrastructure top-level domain (.arpa)\\ngeneric top-level domains (gTLD)\\nrestricted generic top-level domains (grTLD)\\n sponsored top-level domains (sTLD)\\n country code top-level domains (ccTLD)\\ninternationalized top-level domains (IDNs)\\n  internationalized country code top-level domains (IDN ccTLD)  \\n testing top-level domains (tTLD) \\nHistory[edit]\\nThe initial set of generic top-level domains, defined by RFC 920 in October 1984, was a set of \\\"general purpose domains\\\":  com ,  edu ,  gov ,  mil ,  org . The  net  domain was added with the first implementation of these domains. The com, net, and org TLDs, despite their originally specified goals, are now open to use for any purpose.\\n In November 1988, another TLD was introduced,  int . This TLD was introduced in response to NATO's request for a domain name which adequately reflected its character as an international organization. It was also originally planned to be used for some Internet infrastructure databases, such as ip6.int, the IPv6 equivalent of in-addr.arpa. However, in May 2000, the Internet Architecture Board proposed to exclude infrastructure databases from the int domain. All new databases of this type would be created in  arpa  (a legacy domain from the conversion of ARPANET), and existing usage would move to arpa wherever feasible, which led to the use of ip6.arpa for IPv6 reverse lookups.\\n By the mid-1990s there was discussion of introduction of more TLDs. Jon Postel, as head of IANA, invited applications from interested parties. In early 1995, Postel created \\\"Draft Postel\\\", an Internet draft containing the procedures to create new domain name registries and new TLDs. [4]  Draft Postel created a number of small committees to approve the new TLDs. Because of the increasing interest, a number of large organizations took over the process under the Internet Society's umbrella. This second attempt involved setting up a temporary organization called the International Ad Hoc Committee (IAHC). On February 4, 1997, the IAHC issued a report ignoring the Draft Postel recommendations and instead recommending the introduction of seven new TLDs (arts, firm, info, nom, rec, store, and web). However, these proposals were abandoned after the U.S. government intervened.[ citation needed ]\\n In September 1998, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) was created to take over the task of managing domain names. After a call for proposals (August 15, 2000) and a brief period of public consultation, ICANN announced on November 16, 2000 its selection of seven new TLDs:  aero ,  biz ,  coop ,  info ,  museum ,  name ,  pro .\\n   biz ,  info , and  museum  were activated in June 2001,  name  and  coop  in January 2002,  pro  in May 2002, and  aero  later in 2002.  pro  became a gTLD in May 2002, but did not become fully operational until June 2004.\\n ICANN added further TLDs, starting with a set of sponsored top-level domains. The application period for these was from December 15, 2003 to March 16, 2004; it resulted in ten applications. [5]  Of these, ICANN approved  asia ,  cat ,  jobs ,  mobi ,  tel  and  travel . In March 2011, xxx was approved [6]  (one year after an independent review found ICANN had broken its own bylaws by rejecting the application in 2007). [7]  Of the remaining applications ( post ,  mail  and an alternative tel proposal),  post  was introduced in 2012.\\n On June 26, 2008, during the 32nd International Public ICANN Meeting in Paris, [8]  ICANN started a new process of TLD naming policy to take a \\\"significant step forward on the introduction of new generic top-level domains.\\\" This program envisioned the availability of many new or\"\n",

      "  \"comprehensive_report\": \"## Comprehensive Report: Edutech, GenAI, and Upskilling Opportunities\\n\\nThis report synthesizes information from multiple research reports to provide a comprehensive overview of the Edutech and GenAI market, focusing on education placements and upskilling opportunities in GenAI and image diffusion models.  The analysis highlights key trends, challenges, and strategic recommendations for stakeholders.\\n\\n\\n**I. Market Overview (2019-2024):**\\n\\nThe Edutech market, particularly the segment incorporating AI, has experienced exponential growth, significantly accelerating after the 2020 pandemic.  The emergence of GenAI in 2023 marked a major inflection point, revolutionizing possibilities for personalized learning, content creation, and assessment. While precise figures for the GenAI subset are unavailable, its rapid growth is undeniable, fueled by increased investment and significant funding rounds (e.g., Kyron Learning in 2023).  The market, initially fragmented, is undergoing consolidation through acquisitions, with larger players acquiring smaller startups. Government initiatives and industry collaborations are further driving AI adoption in education.\\n\\nImage diffusion models represent a newer application within the EdTech landscape, with potential for creating interactive visual learning materials and innovative assessment tools, although their current market penetration is limited.\\n\\n\\n**II.  Edutech Platform Functionalities:**\\n\\nEdutech platforms supporting education placements fall into two main categories:\\n\\n* **General K-12/Higher Ed Platforms:** These platforms (e.g., Blackbaud, PowerSchool, Canvas) primarily focus on Student Information Systems (SIS) and Learning Management Systems (LMS). While not directly managing placements, they provide crucial student data for placement programs.  Supplementary tools for literacy, behavior management, and skill assessment enhance learning but don't directly handle placements.\\n\\n* **Specialized Work Placement Systems:** These platforms (e.g., Handshake Students, CSM by Symplicity) act as intermediaries between students and employers, offering features like job listings, student-employer matching algorithms, and communication tools.  These systems are crucial for facilitating internships, co-ops, and work experience opportunities.\\n\\n\\n**III. Upskilling Programs in GenAI and Image Diffusion Models:**\\n\\nSpecific upskilling programs in Generative AI and image diffusion models require further research.  The available data doesn't list specific programs.  However, the high potential demand for such skills is evident, given the rapid growth of the GenAI market.  To identify specific programs, future research should focus on online learning platforms (Coursera, edX, Udemy), professional development programs, and university courses.\\n\\n\\n**IV. Target Audience for Upskilling Programs:**\\n\\nWhile specific programs weren't detailed, the target audience for GenAI and image diffusion model upskilling likely includes:\\n\\n* **Students:**  Undergraduate and graduate students seeking to enhance their skills and career prospects.\\n* **Professionals:**  Individuals seeking to transition into AI-related roles or upskill in their current positions.\\n* **Educators:** Teachers and instructors aiming to integrate GenAI tools into their teaching practices.\\n\\n\\n**V. Market Demand and Competition:**\\n\\nThe market for GenAI and image diffusion model upskilling shows high potential demand due to technological advancements and industry adoption.  However, a precise assessment of market size, growth, and competition requires additional research using market reports, online course data, and professional networking site analysis.  The competitive landscape is likely to become increasingly crowded as more providers enter the market.\\n\\n\\n**VI. Marketing and Outreach Strategy:**\\n\\nA successful marketing strategy for Edutech and GenAI upskilling platforms should target distinct audiences with tailored messaging:\\n\\n* **Students:** Highlight career prospects and skill development opportunities.\\n* **Professionals:** Emphasize improved job performance and career advancement.\\n* **Educators:** Focus on enhancing teaching effectiveness and student engagement.\\n\\nMarketing channels should include digital marketing (SEO, PPC, social media), content marketing (blog posts, webinars), public relations, and strategic partnerships.  Key performance indicators (KPIs) should track website traffic, lead generation, and customer acquisition costs.\\n\\n\\n**VII. Strategic Recommendations:**\\n\\n* **Focus on GenAI Integration:** EdTech companies should prioritize integrating GenAI capabilities into their platforms, focusing on personalized learning and automation.\\n* **Develop Ethical Guidelines:** Address concerns about bias, fairness, and data privacy in the use of GenAI in education.\\n* **Invest in Upskilling Initiatives:** Develop and offer comprehensive upskilling programs in GenAI and image diffusion models.\\n* **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Use data analytics to track the impact of AI on student learning and improve program effectiveness.\\n* **Strategic Partnerships:** Collaborate with educational institutions, government agencies, and other stakeholders.\\n* **Targeted Market Research:** Conduct thorough market research to gain a clearer understanding of the GenAI market segment.\\n\\n\\n**VIII. Limitations:**\\n\\nThis report's analysis is limited by the incomplete and inconsistent data provided in the initial reports.  More granular data on specific upskilling programs, market size, and competitive landscape is needed\"\n",
