      "Yearly insights for original query: [{'year': 2019, 'question': 'WHats the market for NPC as an service? in AR, MR and gaming?', 'analysis': 'I do not have access to real-time information, including specific market research data from 2019.  Therefore, I cannot provide a precise analysis of the market for \"NPC as a service\" in AR, MR, and gaming in that year.  Market research reports from that time would be needed for such an analysis.\\n\\nHowever, I can offer a structured framework for analyzing such a market question, based on what would have been relevant factors in 2019:\\n\\n**Analyzing the 2019 Market for NPC-as-a-Service in AR/MR/Gaming:**\\n\\n**1. Market Size and Growth (Data unavailable without 2019 reports):**\\n\\n* **Estimation Approach:**  In the absence of direct data, one would need to estimate the market size by:\\n    * **Bottom-up approach:** Estimating the number of game developers, AR/MR app developers, and their likely spending on NPC services. This would involve surveys, interviews, and extrapolating from publicly available data on game development budgets.\\n    * **Top-down approach:** Estimating the overall market size of AR/MR/gaming and then determining the percentage attributable to NPC-as-a-service. This would require market sizing of the larger industries and then making assumptions about the adoption rate of NPC-as-a-service.\\n\\n* **Growth Factors:** Potential growth drivers in 2019 would have included:\\n    * Increasing complexity of game AI.\\n    * Rising demand for more realistic and engaging NPCs.\\n    * Expanding AR/MR markets.\\n    * The emergence of cloud-based game development platforms.\\n\\n* **Growth Restraints:** Potential restraints in 2019 could have been:\\n    * High development costs associated with advanced NPC AI.\\n    * Limited availability of skilled developers specializing in NPC-as-a-service.\\n    * Concerns about the security and privacy of NPC data.\\n    * Lack of standardized APIs and interoperability between platforms.\\n\\n\\n**2. Key Technological Developments (2019 Context):**\\n\\n* **AI advancements:**  Focus would have been on improvements in machine learning algorithms (e.g., reinforcement learning, deep learning) for creating more sophisticated NPC behaviors.  Natural language processing (NLP) for more realistic NPC dialogue would also have been a focus.\\n* **Cloud computing:**  The increasing use of cloud platforms for game development would have facilitated the delivery of NPC-as-a-service.\\n* **Game engines:**  Improvements in game engines (Unity, Unreal Engine) would have made it easier to integrate NPC-as-a-service solutions.\\n* **AR/MR SDKs:**  Advancements in AR/MR software development kits (SDKs) would have influenced how easily developers could incorporate NPCs into their applications.\\n\\n\\n**3. Major Market Events (Data unavailable without specific research):**\\n\\nThis section would require news articles, press releases, and industry event summaries from 2019.

These service providers offer a platform, which allows customers to develop, run, and manage services without dealing with complex building and maintenance of infrastructure of developing an application. Thus, developers only need to install in-house hardware &amp; software to develop or run a new application. PaaS charge organizations only for compute, network resources consumed, and storage.

Customers control software deployment while cloud providers deliver entire IT component needed to host the application. \\n Access Full Summery Report: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/platfor…ket-A06955  \\n COVID-19 scenario Analysis: \\nThe growing impact of the unpredicted pandemic on economy has hampered the functioning of several sectors, including technology, automation, banking and enterprise information.\\nFlexibility and agility of cloud solutions, ease of provisioning and scaling new resources, pay-per-use model, is a perfect fit for current uncertainty. The popularity of cloud solutions after these uncertain times provide lucrative opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market as working patterns are changing to remote working where possible, and where many interactions are moved to digital channels rather than physical channels to avoid or at least slow down the spread of the virus. \\nAs the adoption of cloud technology has increased in this time, adoption of PaaS has increased. It is expected that PaaS investments are expected to increase in number of industry verticals such as healthcare, information technology, and academic sector which boosts growth of the market \\nMany organizations have their digital to-do lists written for them, as weak links become apparent in this sudden shift to digital and remote working, the development of new applications and shift toward digitalization would create multiple opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\n Top impacting factors: Market Scenario Analysis, Trends, Drivers and Impact Analysis \\nAdoption of PaaS is on the rise among end users, owing to its numerous benefits such as cost reduction, less time consumption, and scalability; which majorly drives growth of the market. In addition, rise in adoption of cloud-based services, increase in use of internet of things, and rise in demand for application development platforms further fuel growth of the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\nHowever, factors such as less data security, integrations issues, and challenges with customization of legacy systems restraints the growth of the market. Furthermore, ongoing large investments by major IT vendors in the PaaS is opportunistic for the market.\\n Get sample report for more details: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-sample/7320  \\n Growth in need for PaaS  \\nMany organizations are expecting that with growth in digitalization, payments would create a cloud native environment and organizations would need to hire a 3rd party provider, which can use domestic, cross border, and regional payment solutions via a single interface. In addition, providers would also manage complexities and difficulties associated with moving funds. Thus, it is expected that digitalization and online payment with new product launch would create multiple opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\n Dependency on vendor is a major concern:  \\nAs 3rd party providers fulfill most of the requirements for development and deployment of any program, this dependency is expected to act as restraining factor for growth of the market. As businesses are governed by provider’s functional capabilities, reliability and speed, any circumstance may occur resulting in data loss, which, in turn, hampers the growth of the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\n Inquiry more about this report: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/purchas…quiry/7320  \\n Key benefits of the report: \\nThis study presents analytical depiction of the global platform-as-a-service market along with the current trends and future estimations to determine the imminent investment pockets.\\nThe report presents information related to key drivers, restraints, and opportunities along with detailed analysis of the platform as a service market share.\\nThe current market is quantitatively analyzed from 2019 to 2027 to highlight the global platform-as-a-service market growth scenario.\\nPorter’s five forces analysis illustrates the potency of buyers &amp; suppliers in the market. \\nThe report provides detailed cognitive media market analysis based on competitive intensity and how the competition will take shape in coming years. \\n Regions Covered \\nNorth America (U.S. and Canada)\\nEurope (Germany, UK, France, and Rest of Europe)\\nAsia-Pacific (China, Japan, India, and Rest of Asia Pacific)\\nLAMEA (Latin America, Middle East, and Africa)\\n Companies Covered \\nMicrosoft Corp.\\nGoogle LLC.\\nAmazon Web Services Inc.\\nSalesforce.

service in AR, MR, and gaming\" in 2020 based on real-time search results.  My knowledge is not connected to live search engines or specific market data aggregators.  Information on niche market segments like this from 2020 would require access to specialized market research reports, databases, and news archives from that time period.\\n\\nHowever, I can offer a *hypothetical* analysis based on the general trends and developments in the relevant fields in 2020:\\n\\n\\n**Hypothetical Analysis of the NPC-as-a-Service Market in AR/MR/Gaming (2020)**\\n\\n**1. Market Size and Growth:**\\n\\n* **Small and Emerging:** In 2020, the market for NPC-as-a-service was likely very small and still in its nascent stages.  The concept was probably more of an emerging trend than a well-established market.  Precise sizing would be difficult to determine without dedicated market research.\\n* **Growth Potential:**  The potential for growth was significant, driven by the increasing adoption of AR/MR technologies and the continued expansion of the gaming industry. The promise of easily customizable and scalable NPCs could have attracted developers seeking to reduce development costs and time.\\n\\n**2. Key Technological Developments:**\\n\\n* **AI advancements:**  Improvements in AI, particularly in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML), were crucial. These technologies enabled the creation of more realistic and engaging NPCs with dynamic behaviors.\\n* **Cloud computing infrastructure:** The maturation of cloud computing platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) provided the necessary infrastructure for delivering NPC-as-a-service.  Scalability and accessibility were key benefits.\\n* **Game engines and development tools:**  Game engines like Unity and Unreal Engine likely incorporated features or plugins that facilitated the integration of AI-powered NPCs.\\n\\n**3. Major Market Events:**\\n\\n* **Limited Public Events:**  Given the nascent stage, there were likely few major public events specifically focused on NPC-as-a-service.  However, broader industry events covering AI in gaming, AR/MR development, or cloud computing might have featured presentations or discussions related to this area.\\n* **Strategic Partnerships:**  Potential significant events could have included strategic partnerships between AI companies and game developers or AR/MR platform providers to develop and deploy NPC-as-a-service solutions.\\n\\n\\n**4. Investment Trends:**\\n\\n* **Early-stage funding:**  Investment in this area was likely focused on early-stage startups developing the core technologies and platforms for NPC-as-a-service.  Venture capital and angel investors might have been the primary sources of funding.\\n* **Strategic acquisitions:**  Larger companies in the gaming or AR/MR space might have acquired smaller startups with promising NPC-as-a-service technology.\\n\\n\\n**5. Competitive Landscape Shifts:**\\n\\n* **Few established players:**  In 2020, the competitive landscape was likely fragmented, with many small startups competing.  There were probably few large, established players dominating the market.\\n* **Focus on differentiation:**  Companies likely focused on differentiating their offerings through unique AI capabilities, specialized game engine integrations, or targeted market segments (e.g., specific game genres or AR/MR applications).\\n\\n\\n**To find actual 2020 data:**\\n\\nYou would need to search for market research reports from firms like Gartner, IDC, Newzoo, or similar companies specializing in the gaming, AR/MR, and AI sectors.  Look for reports that specifically cover AI in gaming or cloud-based game development services. You might also find relevant information in industry publications and news archives from 2020.  Remember to critically evaluate the sources and their methodologies.\\n', 'raw_search_results': ['News Categories           \\n \\nGuest Post By \\nPawan Kumar\\nInformation Technology Markets\\n2020-12-24\\t\\n \\nThe Objective of the Platform-as-a-Service Market report is to depict the trends and upcoming for Platform-as-a-Service Industry over the forecast years. In Platform-as-a-Service Market report data has been gathered from industry specialists/experts. Although the market size of the market is studied and predicted from 2020 to 2027 mulling over 2019 as the base year of the market study. Attentiveness for the market has increased in recent decades due to development and improvement in the innovation.\\n Platform-as-a-Service Market Statistics \\nPlatform-as-a-service (PaaS) is a cloud service delivery model in which third party cloud service providers deliver some hardware and software tools to those who are in need of complete development and deployment of applications over the internet. These service providers offer a platform, which allows customers to develop, run, and manage services without dealing with complex building and maintenance of infrastructure of developing an application. Thus, developers only need to install in-house hardware &amp; software to develop or run a new application. PaaS charge organizations only for compute, network resources consumed, and storage. It can be delivered through public, private, and hybrid clouds. Customers control software deployment while cloud providers deliver entire IT component needed to host the application. \\n Access Full Summery Report: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/platfor…ket-A06955  \\n COVID-19 scenario Analysis: \\nThe growing impact of the unpredicted pandemic on economy has hampered the functioning of several sectors, including technology, automation, banking and enterprise information.\\nFlexibility and agility of cloud solutions, ease of provisioning and scaling new resources, pay-per-use model, is a perfect fit for current uncertainty. The popularity of cloud solutions after these uncertain times provide lucrative opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market as working patterns are changing to remote working where possible, and where many interactions are moved to digital channels rather than physical channels to avoid or at least slow down the spread of the virus. \\nAs the adoption of cloud technology has increased in this time, adoption of PaaS has increased. It is expected that PaaS investments are expected to increase in number of industry verticals such as healthcare, information technology, and academic sector which boosts growth of the market \\nMany organizations have their digital to-do lists written for them, as weak links become apparent in this sudden shift to digital and remote working, the development of new applications and shift toward digitalization would create multiple opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\n Top impacting factors: Market Scenario Analysis, Trends, Drivers and Impact Analysis \\nAdoption of PaaS is on the rise among end users, owing to its numerous benefits such as cost reduction, less time consumption, and scalability; which majorly drives growth of the market. In addition, rise in adoption of cloud-based services, increase in use of internet of things, and rise in demand for application development platforms further fuel growth of the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\nHowever, factors such as less data security, integrations issues, and challenges with customization of legacy systems restraints the growth of the market. Furthermore, ongoing large investments by major IT vendors in the PaaS is opportunistic for the market.\\n Get sample report for more details: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-sample/7320  \\n Growth in need for PaaS  \\nMany organizations are expecting that with growth in digitalization, payments would create a cloud native environment and organizations would need to hire a 3rd party provider, which can use domestic, cross border, and regional payment solutions via a single interface. In addition, providers would also manage complexities and difficulties associated with moving funds. Thus, it is expected that digitalization and online payment with new product launch would create multiple opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\n Dependency on vendor is a major concern:  \\nAs 3rd party providers fulfill most of the requirements for development and deployment of any program, this dependency is expected to act as restraining factor for growth of the market. As businesses are governed by provider’s functional capabilities, reliability and speed, any circumstance may occur resulting in data loss, which, in turn, hampers the growth of the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\n Inquiry more about this report: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/purchas…quiry/7320  \\n Key benefits of the report: \\nThis study presents analytical depiction of the global platform-as-a-service market along with the current trends and future estimations to determine the imminent investment pockets.\\nThe report presents information related to key drivers, restraints, and opportunities along with detailed analysis of the platform as a service market share.\\nThe current market is quantitatively analyzed from 2019 to 2027 to highlight the global platform-as-a-service market growth scenario.\\nPorter’s five forces analysis illustrates the potency of buyers &amp; suppliers in the market. \\nThe report provides detailed cognitive media market analysis based on competitive intensity and how the competition will take shape in coming years. \\n Regions Covered \\nNorth America (U.S. and Canada)\\nEurope (Germany, UK, France, and Rest of Europe)\\nAsia-Pacific (China, Japan, India, and Rest of Asia Pacific)\\nLAMEA (Latin America, Middle East, and Africa)\\n Companies Covered \\nMicrosoft Corp.\\nGoogle LLC.\\nAmazon Web Services Inc.\\nSalesforce.

This is because:\\n\\n1. **Data Scarcity:**  The phrase \"NPC as a service\" wasn\\'t a widely established or tracked market segment in 2021.  While the underlying technologies (AI, game development, AR/MR platforms) were active, the specific bundling of non-player characters as a service offering was nascent.  Therefore, there wouldn\\'t have been readily available market reports or comprehensive data from search engines.\\n\\n2. **Search Engine Limitations:** Search engines index what\\'s publicly available.  If the market was small and largely internal to companies, it wouldn\\'t show up prominently in search results.\\n\\n3. **Definition Ambiguity:** The term \"NPC as a service\" needs further clarification.  Does it refer to:\\n    * **Pre-built NPC assets:**  Companies selling ready-made NPC models, animations, and basic AI behaviors for game developers to integrate.\\n    * **NPC generation tools:**  Software or platforms that allow developers to easily create and customize NPCs with varying levels of AI.\\n    * **Backend NPC services:**  Cloud-based services that handle the complex computations and interactions of many NPCs in a game or AR/MR environment.\\n    * **Live NPC control:** Services that allow real-time control and manipulation of NPCs by human operators (e.g., for immersive experiences).\\n\\nTo perform a proper analysis, we\\'d need concrete market research data, which is unlikely to exist for such a niche area in 2021.\\n\\n**However, I can provide a speculative analysis based on the likely trends and developments of the constituent technologies in 2021:**\\n\\n**- Market Size and Growth (Speculative):**  The market in 2021 would have been very small, likely in the early stages of development.  Growth would have been limited but potentially rapid as the underlying technologies matured.\\n\\n**- Key Technological Developments (2021):**\\n\\n* **Advancements in AI:**  Significant progress was made in natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and deep learning, which are crucial for creating more realistic and believable NPC behavior.  This would have laid the groundwork for more sophisticated NPC-as-a-service offerings.\\n* **Game Engines and Development Tools:**  Game engines like Unity and Unreal Engine continued to improve their tools for creating and managing NPCs, potentially paving the way for easier integration of external NPC services.\\n* **Cloud Computing:** Cloud infrastructure became more powerful and accessible, making it feasible to host complex NPC AI and simulations in the cloud, a key component of \"NPC as a service.\"\\n* **AR/MR Development:** AR/MR platforms were still developing, but the increasing capabilities in spatial computing and object recognition were making more advanced NPC interactions in augmented and mixed reality environments possible.\\n\\n**- Major Market Events (Speculative):**  No major public market events specifically focused on \"NPC as a service\" likely occurred in 2021.  However, relevant events would have included game developer conferences (GDC), AI conferences, and AR/MR industry events where related technologies were showcased.\\n\\n**- Investment Trends (Speculative):**  Investment in AI, game development, and AR/MR technologies was strong in 2021.  While direct investment in \"NPC as a service\" companies may have been limited, funding in related areas would have indirectly supported the development of this potential market.\\n\\n**- Competitive Landscape Shifts (Speculative):** The competitive landscape would have been fragmented, with various companies focusing on different aspects of NPC technology.  Larger game studios may have been developing their own internal solutions, while smaller companies might have explored offering specific NPC-related services.\\n\\n\\n**In summary:**  While a precise market analysis for \"NPC as a service\" in 2021 is impossible without dedicated market research data from that time, the technological advancements of 2021 clearly laid the foundation for such a market to emerge and grow in subsequent years. To get a better picture of the current state of this market, you would need to search for more recent market reports focusing on AI-powered NPCs in games and AR/MR applications.\\n', 'raw_search_results': ['News Categories           \\n \\nGuest Post By \\nPawan Kumar\\nInformation Technology Markets\\n2020-12-24\\t\\n \\nThe Objective of the Platform-as-a-Service Market report is to depict the trends and upcoming for Platform-as-a-Service Industry over the forecast years. In Platform-as-a-Service Market report data has been gathered from industry specialists/experts. Although the market size of the market is studied and predicted from 2020 to 2027 mulling over 2019 as the base year of the market study. Attentiveness for the market has increased in recent decades due to development and improvement in the innovation.\\n Platform-as-a-Service Market Statistics \\nPlatform-as-a-service (PaaS) is a cloud service delivery model in which third party cloud service providers deliver some hardware and software tools to those who are in need of complete development and deployment of applications over the internet. These service providers offer a platform, which allows customers to develop, run, and manage services without dealing with complex building and maintenance of infrastructure of developing an application. Thus, developers only need to install in-house hardware &amp; software to develop or run a new application. PaaS charge organizations only for compute, network resources consumed, and storage. It can be delivered through public, private, and hybrid clouds. Customers control software deployment while cloud providers deliver entire IT component needed to host the application. \\n Access Full Summery Report: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/platfor…ket-A06955  \\n COVID-19 scenario Analysis: \\nThe growing impact of the unpredicted pandemic on economy has hampered the functioning of several sectors, including technology, automation, banking and enterprise information.\\nFlexibility and agility of cloud solutions, ease of provisioning and scaling new resources, pay-per-use model, is a perfect fit for current uncertainty. The popularity of cloud solutions after these uncertain times provide lucrative opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market as working patterns are changing to remote working where possible, and where many interactions are moved to digital channels rather than physical channels to avoid or at least slow down the spread of the virus. \\nAs the adoption of cloud technology has increased in this time, adoption of PaaS has increased. It is expected that PaaS investments are expected to increase in number of industry verticals such as healthcare, information technology, and academic sector which boosts growth of the market \\nMany organizations have their digital to-do lists written for them, as weak links become apparent in this sudden shift to digital and remote working, the development of new applications and shift toward digitalization would create multiple opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\n Top impacting factors: Market Scenario Analysis, Trends, Drivers and Impact Analysis \\nAdoption of PaaS is on the rise among end users, owing to its numerous benefits such as cost reduction, less time consumption, and scalability; which majorly drives growth of the market. In addition, rise in adoption of cloud-based services, increase in use of internet of things, and rise in demand for application development platforms further fuel growth of the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\nHowever, factors such as less data security, integrations issues, and challenges with customization of legacy systems restraints the growth of the market. Furthermore, ongoing large investments by major IT vendors in the PaaS is opportunistic for the market.\\n Get sample report for more details: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-sample/7320  \\n Growth in need for PaaS  \\nMany organizations are expecting that with growth in digitalization, payments would create a cloud native environment and organizations would need to hire a 3rd party provider, which can use domestic, cross border, and regional payment solutions via a single interface. In addition, providers would also manage complexities and difficulties associated with moving funds. Thus, it is expected that digitalization and online payment with new product launch would create multiple opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\n Dependency on vendor is a major concern:  \\nAs 3rd party providers fulfill most of the requirements for development and deployment of any program, this dependency is expected to act as restraining factor for growth of the market. As businesses are governed by provider’s functional capabilities, reliability and speed, any circumstance may occur resulting in data loss, which, in turn, hampers the growth of the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\n Inquiry more about this report: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/purchas…quiry/7320  \\n Key benefits of the report: \\nThis study presents analytical depiction of the global platform-as-a-service market along with the current trends and future estimations to determine the imminent investment pockets.\\nThe report presents information related to key drivers, restraints, and opportunities along with detailed analysis of the platform as a service market share.\\nThe current market is quantitatively analyzed from 2019 to 2027 to highlight the global platform-as-a-service market growth scenario.\\nPorter’s five forces analysis illustrates the potency of buyers &amp; suppliers in the market. \\nThe report provides detailed cognitive media market analysis based on competitive intensity and how the competition will take shape in coming years. \\n Regions Covered \\nNorth America (U.S. and Canada)\\nEurope (Germany, UK, France, and Rest of Europe)\\nAsia-Pacific (China, Japan, India, and Rest of Asia Pacific)\\nLAMEA (Latin America, Middle East, and Africa)\\n Companies Covered \\nMicrosoft Corp.\\nGoogle LLC.\\nAmazon Web Services Inc.\\nSalesforce.

gaming?', 'analysis': 'Analyzing the market for \"NPC as a Service\" (NPCaaS) in AR/MR and gaming in 2022 requires a nuanced approach because readily available, comprehensive market reports specifically on NPCaaS are scarce.  The concept itself is relatively new and often falls under broader categories like AI in gaming, cloud gaming services, or real-time 3D development platforms. Therefore, the analysis will be based on piecing together information from related market trends and news articles from 2022.\\n\\n**1. Market Size and Growth:**\\n\\n* **Difficult to Quantify Directly:**  No specific market size data for NPCaaS existed in 2022.  Estimating its size would require extrapolating from the overall growth of the AR/MR and gaming markets, and the increasing adoption of AI and cloud services within those sectors.\\n* **Indirect Indicators of Growth:**  The significant growth in the broader markets of AR/MR (augmented and mixed reality) and gaming, coupled with rising investments in AI and cloud-based game development tools, strongly suggests a nascent but growing market for NPCaaS.  The increasing demand for more realistic and engaging NPCs points towards increasing adoption.\\n* **Growth Drivers:**  Factors like the increasing sophistication of AI, the rise of cloud computing, and the growing demand for more immersive and personalized gaming experiences all contribute to potential NPCaaS market growth.\\n\\n\\n**2. Key Technological Developments:**\\n\\n* **Advances in AI:**  Progress in natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and deep learning facilitated the creation of more intelligent and believable NPCs.  This included advancements in behavior trees, decision-making algorithms, and emotion modeling.\\n* **Real-time 3D Technologies:**  Improvements in real-time rendering and physics engines allowed for more realistic NPC interactions within AR/MR and gaming environments.  This includes advancements in character animation, physics simulations, and procedural generation.\\n* **Cloud Computing Infrastructure:**  The expansion of cloud computing capabilities provided the necessary infrastructure for hosting and managing complex AI-powered NPCs, enabling scalability and accessibility for developers.\\n\\n\\n**3. Major Market Events (2022):**\\n\\n* **Limited Publicly Available Data:**  Specific events directly focused on the launch of significant NPCaaS platforms or major partnerships were not prominently reported in 2022.  Many developments likely occurred within individual companies.\\n* **Industry Conferences and Announcements:**  News from larger gaming and technology conferences (like GDC, SIGGRAPH, etc.) likely contained mentions of AI advancements relevant to NPC development, but not always explicitly framed as \"NPCaaS.\"  Look for presentations on AI-driven game design and character development.\\n* **Game Releases:**  The release of major games featuring advanced AI-driven NPCs could be considered indirect market events, showcasing the potential of NPCaaS.

In Platform-as-a-Service Market report data has been gathered from industry specialists/experts. Although the market size of the market is studied and predicted from 2020 to 2027 mulling over 2019 as the base year of the market study. Attentiveness for the market has increased in recent decades due to development and improvement in the innovation.\\n Platform-as-a-Service Market Statistics \\nPlatform-as-a-service (PaaS) is a cloud service delivery model in which third party cloud service providers deliver some hardware and software tools to those who are in need of complete development and deployment of applications over the internet. These service providers offer a platform, which allows customers to develop, run, and manage services without dealing with complex building and maintenance of infrastructure of developing an application. Thus, developers only need to install in-house hardware &amp; software to develop or run a new application. PaaS charge organizations only for compute, network resources consumed, and storage. It can be delivered through public, private, and hybrid clouds. Customers control software deployment while cloud providers deliver entire IT component needed to host the application. \\n Access Full Summery Report: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/platfor…ket-A06955  \\n COVID-19 scenario Analysis: \\nThe growing impact of the unpredicted pandemic on economy has hampered the functioning of several sectors, including technology, automation, banking and enterprise information.\\nFlexibility and agility of cloud solutions, ease of provisioning and scaling new resources, pay-per-use model, is a perfect fit for current uncertainty. The popularity of cloud solutions after these uncertain times provide lucrative opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market as working patterns are changing to remote working where possible, and where many interactions are moved to digital channels rather than physical channels to avoid or at least slow down the spread of the virus. \\nAs the adoption of cloud technology has increased in this time, adoption of PaaS has increased. It is expected that PaaS investments are expected to increase in number of industry verticals such as healthcare, information technology, and academic sector which boosts growth of the market \\nMany organizations have their digital to-do lists written for them, as weak links become apparent in this sudden shift to digital and remote working, the development of new applications and shift toward digitalization would create multiple opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\n Top impacting factors: Market Scenario Analysis, Trends, Drivers and Impact Analysis \\nAdoption of PaaS is on the rise among end users, owing to its numerous benefits such as cost reduction, less time consumption, and scalability; which majorly drives growth of the market. In addition, rise in adoption of cloud-based services, increase in use of internet of things, and rise in demand for application development platforms further fuel growth of the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\nHowever, factors such as less data security, integrations issues, and challenges with customization of legacy systems restraints the growth of the market. Furthermore, ongoing large investments by major IT vendors in the PaaS is opportunistic for the market.\\n Get sample report for more details: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-sample/7320  \\n Growth in need for PaaS  \\nMany organizations are expecting that with growth in digitalization, payments would create a cloud native environment and organizations would need to hire a 3rd party provider, which can use domestic, cross border, and regional payment solutions via a single interface. In addition, providers would also manage complexities and difficulties associated with moving funds. Thus, it is expected that digitalization and online payment with new product launch would create multiple opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\n Dependency on vendor is a major concern:  \\nAs 3rd party providers fulfill most of the requirements for development and deployment of any program, this dependency is expected to act as restraining factor for growth of the market. As businesses are governed by provider’s functional capabilities, reliability and speed, any circumstance may occur resulting in data loss, which, in turn, hampers the growth of the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\n Inquiry more about this report: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/purchas…quiry/7320  \\n Key benefits of the report: \\nThis study presents analytical depiction of the global platform-as-a-service market along with the current trends and future estimations to determine the imminent investment pockets.\\nThe report presents information related to key drivers, restraints, and opportunities along with detailed analysis of the platform as a service market share.\\nThe current market is quantitatively analyzed from 2019 to 2027 to highlight the global platform-as-a-service market growth scenario.\\nPorter’s five forces analysis illustrates the potency of buyers &amp; suppliers in the market. \\nThe report provides detailed cognitive media market analysis based on competitive intensity and how the competition will take shape in coming years. \\n Regions Covered \\nNorth America (U.S. and Canada)\\nEurope (Germany, UK, France, and Rest of Europe)\\nAsia-Pacific (China, Japan, India, and Rest of Asia Pacific)\\nLAMEA (Latin America, Middle East, and Africa)\\n Companies Covered \\nMicrosoft Corp.\\nGoogle LLC.\\nAmazon Web Services Inc.\\nSalesforce.

\\n 1 \\n 2 \\n 3']}, {'year': 2023, 'question': 'WHats the market for NPC as an service? in AR, MR and gaming?', 'analysis': 'Analyzing the market for \"NPC as a service (NPaaS)\" in AR, MR, and gaming in 2023 requires a nuanced approach because readily available, comprehensive market reports specifically on this niche segment are scarce.  The term itself isn\\'t widely standardized, and the market is likely bundled within broader categories like AI in gaming, AR/MR development tools, or cloud-based game development services.  Therefore, this analysis will be based on inferential reasoning from related market trends.\\n\\n\\n**1. Market Size and Growth:**\\n\\n* **Indirect Estimation:**  We can estimate the market size indirectly. The overall market for AR/MR and gaming is substantial and growing rapidly.  The market for AI and machine learning in gaming, a key component of realistic and engaging NPCs, is also experiencing significant growth.  A portion of the spending in these broader categories can be attributed to NPaaS, but quantifying that portion precisely is challenging without dedicated market research.  Reports on AI in gaming or cloud gaming services provide a helpful, albeit broad, context.\\n\\n* **Growth Drivers:** Several factors drive growth:\\n    * **Increased Realism:** Gamers demand more realistic and engaging NPCs, pushing the need for advanced AI and NPaaS solutions.\\n    * **Reduced Development Costs:** NPaaS can significantly reduce development time and costs for game developers, making it attractive for smaller studios and indie developers.\\n    * **Scalability:** Cloud-based NPaaS solutions offer scalability, allowing developers to easily adjust the number and complexity of NPCs based on demand.\\n    * **AR/MR Expansion:**  The growing adoption of AR/MR technologies opens up new avenues for NPaaS, creating interactive experiences beyond traditional gaming.\\n\\n* **Growth Challenges:**\\n    * **Technological Limitations:**  Creating truly intelligent and believable NPCs remains a challenge.  Current AI may struggle with complex interactions and unpredictable player behavior.\\n    * **Data Requirements:**  Training sophisticated NPC AI requires vast amounts of data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to acquire.\\n    * **Security Concerns:**  Cloud-based NPaaS solutions raise concerns about data security and the potential for exploits.\\n\\n\\n**2. Key Technological Developments:**\\n\\n* **Advancements in AI:**  Improvements in natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and deep learning are crucial for enhancing NPC behavior and creating more realistic dialogue and interactions.  Specific advancements in reinforcement learning and generative AI are particularly relevant.\\n\\n* **Cloud Computing Infrastructure:**  The development of more powerful and affordable cloud computing platforms is essential for supporting the computational demands of complex NPC AI.  Edge computing solutions are also becoming increasingly important for reducing latency in AR/MR applications.\\n\\n* **Game Engines and Development Tools:**  Game engines (Unity, Unreal Engine) are constantly evolving to better integrate AI and provide tools for managing and deploying NPaaS solutions.\\n\\n\\n**3. Major Market Events:**\\n\\n* **Lack of Specific Events:** There haven\\'t been any singular, highly publicized \"market events\" specifically focused on NPaaS. However, major game releases featuring highly advanced NPCs, or announcements from large tech companies integrating AI into their gaming platforms, indirectly signal progress in this area.  Keep an eye on industry conferences like GDC (Game Developers Conference) and industry news for relevant announcements.\\n\\n\\n**4. Investment Trends:**\\n\\n* **Venture Capital and Private Equity:**  Investment in AI and gaming is high, with a significant portion likely flowing into companies developing advanced NPC technologies, even if not explicitly labeled as \"NPaaS.\"  Tracking investments in AI-focused gaming studios or companies specializing in game development tools will provide insights.\\n\\n* **Strategic Acquisitions:**  Large game publishers and technology companies are likely to acquire smaller companies specializing in NPC AI to strengthen their capabilities.\\n\\n\\n**5. Competitive Landscape Shifts:**\\n\\n* **Emerging Players:** Smaller startups and independent developers are likely leading innovation in NPaaS, often focusing on specific niches within AR/MR or gaming genres.\\n\\n* **Established Players:**  Large tech companies (Google, Microsoft, Amazon) and game publishers are increasingly integrating AI into their platforms and games, indirectly competing in the NPaaS space.  Their focus is often on broader AI integration, not a dedicated NPaaS offering.\\n\\n* **Open-Source Initiatives:**  Open-source AI projects and libraries are contributing to the development of NPaaS technologies, fostering collaboration and innovation.\\n\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\n\\nThe market for NPC as a service is nascent but holds significant potential.  Its growth is intrinsically linked to the broader growth of AI, AR/MR, and the gaming industry. Due to the lack of precise market data, continuous monitoring of related market segments, technological advancements, and investment activity is crucial to understand the evolving landscape of NPaaS.  Future research should focus on defining clearer market boundaries and conducting dedicated market research to provide more accurate size and growth projections.\\n', 'raw_search_results': ['News Categories           \\n \\nGuest Post By \\nPawan Kumar\\nInformation Technology Markets\\n2020-12-24\\t\\n \\nThe Objective of the Platform-as-a-Service Market report is to depict the trends and upcoming for Platform-as-a-Service Industry over the forecast years. In Platform-as-a-Service Market report data has been gathered from industry specialists/experts. Although the market size of the market is studied and predicted from 2020 to 2027 mulling over 2019 as the base year of the market study. Attentiveness for the market has increased in recent decades due to development and improvement in the innovation.\\n Platform-as-a-Service Market Statistics \\nPlatform-as-a-service (PaaS) is a cloud service delivery model in which third party cloud service providers deliver some hardware and software tools to those who are in need of complete development and deployment of applications over the internet. These service providers offer a platform, which allows customers to develop, run, and manage services without dealing with complex building and maintenance of infrastructure of developing an application. Thus, developers only need to install in-house hardware &amp; software to develop or run a new application. PaaS charge organizations only for compute, network resources consumed, and storage. It can be delivered through public, private, and hybrid clouds. Customers control software deployment while cloud providers deliver entire IT component needed to host the application. \\n Access Full Summery Report: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/platfor…ket-A06955  \\n COVID-19 scenario Analysis: \\nThe growing impact of the unpredicted pandemic on economy has hampered the functioning of several sectors, including technology, automation, banking and enterprise information.\\nFlexibility and agility of cloud solutions, ease of provisioning and scaling new resources, pay-per-use model, is a perfect fit for current uncertainty. The popularity of cloud solutions after these uncertain times provide lucrative opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market as working patterns are changing to remote working where possible, and where many interactions are moved to digital channels rather than physical channels to avoid or at least slow down the spread of the virus. \\nAs the adoption of cloud technology has increased in this time, adoption of PaaS has increased. It is expected that PaaS investments are expected to increase in number of industry verticals such as healthcare, information technology, and academic sector which boosts growth of the market \\nMany organizations have their digital to-do lists written for them, as weak links become apparent in this sudden shift to digital and remote working, the development of new applications and shift toward digitalization would create multiple opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\n Top impacting factors: Market Scenario Analysis, Trends, Drivers and Impact Analysis \\nAdoption of PaaS is on the rise among end users, owing to its numerous benefits such as cost reduction, less time consumption, and scalability; which majorly drives growth of the market. In addition, rise in adoption of cloud-based services, increase in use of internet of things, and rise in demand for application development platforms further fuel growth of the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\nHowever, factors such as less data security, integrations issues, and challenges with customization of legacy systems restraints the growth of the market. Furthermore, ongoing large investments by major IT vendors in the PaaS is opportunistic for the market.\\n Get sample report for more details: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-sample/7320  \\n Growth in need for PaaS  \\nMany organizations are expecting that with growth in digitalization, payments would create a cloud native environment and organizations would need to hire a 3rd party provider, which can use domestic, cross border, and regional payment solutions via a single interface. In addition, providers would also manage complexities and difficulties associated with moving funds. Thus, it is expected that digitalization and online payment with new product launch would create multiple opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\n Dependency on vendor is a major concern:  \\nAs 3rd party providers fulfill most of the requirements for development and deployment of any program, this dependency is expected to act as restraining factor for growth of the market. As businesses are governed by provider’s functional capabilities, reliability and speed, any circumstance may occur resulting in data loss, which, in turn, hampers the growth of the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\n Inquiry more about this report: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/purchas…quiry/7320  \\n Key benefits of the report: \\nThis study presents analytical depiction of the global platform-as-a-service market along with the current trends and future estimations to determine the imminent investment pockets.\\nThe report presents information related to key drivers, restraints, and opportunities along with detailed analysis of the platform as a service market share.\\nThe current market is quantitatively analyzed from 2019 to 2027 to highlight the global platform-as-a-service market growth scenario.\\nPorter’s five forces analysis illustrates the potency of buyers &amp; suppliers in the market. \\nThe report provides detailed cognitive media market analysis based on competitive intensity and how the competition will take shape in coming years. \\n Regions Covered \\nNorth America (U.S. and Canada)\\nEurope (Germany, UK, France, and Rest of Europe)\\nAsia-Pacific (China, Japan, India, and Rest of Asia Pacific)\\nLAMEA (Latin America, Middle East, and Africa)\\n Companies Covered \\nMicrosoft Corp.\\nGoogle LLC.\\nAmazon Web Services Inc.\\nSalesforce.

Major Market Events (Inferred):**\\n\\n* **Increased Venture Capital Investment:**  We can anticipate an increase in funding for startups developing NPC-as-a-service platforms and tools.  This will be driven by the potential of the underlying technology and the demand from game and AR/MR developers.\\n\\n* **Strategic Partnerships:**  Larger game studios and AR/MR companies might partner with AI specialists to integrate advanced NPC technologies into their products.\\n\\n* **API and SDK Releases:**  The emergence of readily available APIs and SDKs (Software Development Kits) will be a key market event, making it easier for developers to incorporate NPC-as-a-service into their projects.  This will accelerate adoption.\\n\\n* **Industry Conferences and Presentations:**  Discussions and demonstrations of NPC-as-a-service solutions at gaming and AR/MR industry conferences will help shape the market\\'s trajectory.\\n\\n\\n**4. Investment Trends:**\\n\\n* **Focus on AI-driven NPCs:**  Investors will likely prioritize companies developing advanced AI-driven NPCs over simpler, rule-based alternatives.  The potential for creating truly immersive and engaging experiences will drive investment decisions.\\n\\n* **Cross-platform compatibility:**  Investment will favor solutions compatible with multiple platforms (PC, mobile, consoles, AR/VR headsets) to broaden the market reach.\\n\\n* **Scalability and efficiency:**  Efficient and scalable platforms that can handle a large number of concurrent NPCs will be attractive to investors.\\n\\n\\n**5. Competitive Landscape Shifts:**\\n\\n* **Emergence of specialized platforms:**  We expect to see the emergence of specialized platforms offering NPC-as-a-service tailored to specific needs (e.g., a platform for realistic dialogue, another for complex behavior modeling).\\n\\n* **Consolidation:**  As the market matures, there might be consolidation through mergers and acquisitions, with larger companies acquiring smaller startups to gain a competitive edge.\\n\\n* **Open-source vs. proprietary solutions:**  The availability of open-source tools and platforms might influence the competitive landscape, potentially fostering innovation and reducing the barrier to entry for smaller developers.\\n\\n\\n**In summary:** The \"NPC as a service\" market is nascent but holds immense potential. Its growth will be closely tied to the advancements in AI, cloud computing, and the overall expansion of the AR/MR and gaming industries. While precise market size data is currently unavailable, the market is expected to show substantial growth in the coming years.  Tracking industry news, venture capital funding announcements, and the release of new platforms and tools will provide the best insights into the evolving competitive landscape.\\n', 'raw_search_results': ['News Categories           \\n \\nGuest Post By \\nPawan Kumar\\nInformation Technology Markets\\n2020-12-24\\t\\n \\nThe Objective of the Platform-as-a-Service Market report is to depict the trends and upcoming for Platform-as-a-Service Industry over the forecast years. In Platform-as-a-Service Market report data has been gathered from industry specialists/experts. Although the market size of the market is studied and predicted from 2020 to 2027 mulling over 2019 as the base year of the market study. Attentiveness for the market has increased in recent decades due to development and improvement in the innovation.\\n Platform-as-a-Service Market Statistics \\nPlatform-as-a-service (PaaS) is a cloud service delivery model in which third party cloud service providers deliver some hardware and software tools to those who are in need of complete development and deployment of applications over the internet. These service providers offer a platform, which allows customers to develop, run, and manage services without dealing with complex building and maintenance of infrastructure of developing an application. Thus, developers only need to install in-house hardware &amp; software to develop or run a new application. PaaS charge organizations only for compute, network resources consumed, and storage. It can be delivered through public, private, and hybrid clouds. Customers control software deployment while cloud providers deliver entire IT component needed to host the application. \\n Access Full Summery Report: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/platfor…ket-A06955  \\n COVID-19 scenario Analysis: \\nThe growing impact of the unpredicted pandemic on economy has hampered the functioning of several sectors, including technology, automation, banking and enterprise information.\\nFlexibility and agility of cloud solutions, ease of provisioning and scaling new resources, pay-per-use model, is a perfect fit for current uncertainty. The popularity of cloud solutions after these uncertain times provide lucrative opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market as working patterns are changing to remote working where possible, and where many interactions are moved to digital channels rather than physical channels to avoid or at least slow down the spread of the virus. \\nAs the adoption of cloud technology has increased in this time, adoption of PaaS has increased. It is expected that PaaS investments are expected to increase in number of industry verticals such as healthcare, information technology, and academic sector which boosts growth of the market \\nMany organizations have their digital to-do lists written for them, as weak links become apparent in this sudden shift to digital and remote working, the development of new applications and shift toward digitalization would create multiple opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\n Top impacting factors: Market Scenario Analysis, Trends, Drivers and Impact Analysis \\nAdoption of PaaS is on the rise among end users, owing to its numerous benefits such as cost reduction, less time consumption, and scalability; which majorly drives growth of the market. In addition, rise in adoption of cloud-based services, increase in use of internet of things, and rise in demand for application development platforms further fuel growth of the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\nHowever, factors such as less data security, integrations issues, and challenges with customization of legacy systems restraints the growth of the market. Furthermore, ongoing large investments by major IT vendors in the PaaS is opportunistic for the market.\\n Get sample report for more details: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-sample/7320  \\n Growth in need for PaaS  \\nMany organizations are expecting that with growth in digitalization, payments would create a cloud native environment and organizations would need to hire a 3rd party provider, which can use domestic, cross border, and regional payment solutions via a single interface. In addition, providers would also manage complexities and difficulties associated with moving funds. Thus, it is expected that digitalization and online payment with new product launch would create multiple opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\n Dependency on vendor is a major concern:  \\nAs 3rd party providers fulfill most of the requirements for development and deployment of any program, this dependency is expected to act as restraining factor for growth of the market. As businesses are governed by provider’s functional capabilities, reliability and speed, any circumstance may occur resulting in data loss, which, in turn, hampers the growth of the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\n Inquiry more about this report: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/purchas…quiry/7320  \\n Key benefits of the report: \\nThis study presents analytical depiction of the global platform-as-a-service market along with the current trends and future estimations to determine the imminent investment pockets.\\nThe report presents information related to key drivers, restraints, and opportunities along with detailed analysis of the platform as a service market share.\\nThe current market is quantitatively analyzed from 2019 to 2027 to highlight the global platform-as-a-service market growth scenario.\\nPorter’s five forces analysis illustrates the potency of buyers &amp; suppliers in the market. \\nThe report provides detailed cognitive media market analysis based on competitive intensity and how the competition will take shape in coming years. \\n Regions Covered \\nNorth America (U.S. and Canada)\\nEurope (Germany, UK, France, and Rest of Europe)\\nAsia-Pacific (China, Japan, India, and Rest of Asia Pacific)\\nLAMEA (Latin America, Middle East, and Africa)\\n Companies Covered \\nMicrosoft Corp.\\nGoogle LLC.\\nAmazon Web Services Inc.\\nSalesforce.

Therefore, I cannot provide a precise analysis of the market for \"NPC as a service\" in AR, MR, and gaming in that year.  Market research reports from that time would be needed for such an analysis.\\n\\nHowever, I can offer a structured framework for analyzing such a market question, based on what would have been relevant factors in 2019:\\n\\n**Analyzing the 2019 Market for NPC-as-a-Service in AR/MR/Gaming:**\\n\\n**1. Market Size and Growth (Data unavailable without 2019 reports):**\\n\\n* **Estimation Approach:**  In the absence of direct data, one would need to estimate the market size by:\\n    * **Bottom-up approach:** Estimating the number of game developers, AR/MR app developers, and their likely spending on NPC services. This would involve surveys, interviews, and extrapolating from publicly available data on game development budgets.\\n    * **Top-down approach:** Estimating the overall market size of AR/MR/gaming and then determining the percentage attributable to NPC-as-a-service. This would require market sizing of the larger industries and then making assumptions about the adoption rate of NPC-as-a-service.\\n\\n* **Growth Factors:** Potential growth drivers in 2019 would have included:\\n    * Increasing complexity of game AI.\\n    * Rising demand for more realistic and engaging NPCs.\\n    * Expanding AR/MR markets.\\n    * The emergence of cloud-based game development platforms.\\n\\n* **Growth Restraints:** Potential restraints in 2019 could have been:\\n    * High development costs associated with advanced NPC AI.\\n    * Limited availability of skilled developers specializing in NPC-as-a-service.\\n    * Concerns about the security and privacy of NPC data.\\n    * Lack of standardized APIs and interoperability between platforms.\\n\\n\\n**2. Key Technological Developments (2019 Context):**\\n\\n* **AI advancements:**  Focus would have been on improvements in machine learning algorithms (e.g., reinforcement learning, deep learning) for creating more sophisticated NPC behaviors.  Natural language processing (NLP) for more realistic NPC dialogue would also have been a focus.\\n* **Cloud computing:**  The increasing use of cloud platforms for game development would have facilitated the delivery of NPC-as-a-service.\\n* **Game engines:**  Improvements in game engines (Unity, Unreal Engine) would have made it easier to integrate NPC-as-a-service solutions.\\n* **AR/MR SDKs:**  Advancements in AR/MR software development kits (SDKs) would have influenced how easily developers could incorporate NPCs into their applications.\\n\\n\\n**3. Major Market Events (Data unavailable without specific research):**\\n\\nThis section would require news articles, press releases, and industry event summaries from 2019.  It would cover:\\n\\n* **Product launches:** New NPC-as-a-service platforms or significant updates to existing ones.\\n* **Mergers and acquisitions:**  Deals involving companies in the NPC AI or game development spaces.\\n* **Industry conferences and events:**  Discussions and presentations related to NPC-as-a-service at relevant conferences (e.g., GDC, SIGGRAPH).\\n* **Regulatory changes:** Any government regulations impacting the development or use of AI in games or AR/MR applications.\\n\\n\\n**4. Investment Trends (Data unavailable without 2019 reports):**\\n\\n* **Venture capital:**  Information on venture capital investments in startups developing NPC-as-a-service technologies.\\n* **Strategic investments:**  Investments by larger game companies or technology firms in this area.\\n* **IPO activity:**  Any initial public offerings (IPOs) of companies in the relevant sector.\\n\\n\\n**5. Competitive Landscape Shifts (Data unavailable without 2019 reports):**\\n\\nThis section would analyze the key players in the market in 2019, including:\\n\\n* **Market share:**  Estimates of the market share held by different companies offering NPC-as-a-service.\\n* **New entrants:**  Any new companies entering the market.\\n* **Strategic partnerships:**  Collaborations between companies to offer integrated NPC solutions.\\n* **Competitive strategies:**  The competitive strategies employed by different companies (e.g., pricing, product differentiation, marketing).\\n\\n\\n**In summary:** To perform a thorough analysis of the 2019 market for NPC-as-a-service in AR, MR, and gaming, you would need to consult market research reports and industry news from that specific year.  The framework above provides a structure for organizing the findings from such research.\\n',\n",

My knowledge is not connected to live search engines or specific market data aggregators.  Information on niche market segments like this from 2020 would require access to specialized market research reports, databases, and news archives from that time period.\\n\\nHowever, I can offer a *hypothetical* analysis based on the general trends and developments in the relevant fields in 2020:\\n\\n\\n**Hypothetical Analysis of the NPC-as-a-Service Market in AR/MR/Gaming (2020)**\\n\\n**1. Market Size and Growth:**\\n\\n* **Small and Emerging:** In 2020, the market for NPC-as-a-service was likely very small and still in its nascent stages.  The concept was probably more of an emerging trend than a well-established market.  Precise sizing would be difficult to determine without dedicated market research.\\n* **Growth Potential:**  The potential for growth was significant, driven by the increasing adoption of AR/MR technologies and the continued expansion of the gaming industry. The promise of easily customizable and scalable NPCs could have attracted developers seeking to reduce development costs and time.\\n\\n**2. Key Technological Developments:**\\n\\n* **AI advancements:**  Improvements in AI, particularly in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML), were crucial. These technologies enabled the creation of more realistic and engaging NPCs with dynamic behaviors.\\n* **Cloud computing infrastructure:** The maturation of cloud computing platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) provided the necessary infrastructure for delivering NPC-as-a-service.  Scalability and accessibility were key benefits.\\n* **Game engines and development tools:**  Game engines like Unity and Unreal Engine likely incorporated features or plugins that facilitated the integration of AI-powered NPCs.\\n\\n**3. Major Market Events:**\\n\\n* **Limited Public Events:**  Given the nascent stage, there were likely few major public events specifically focused on NPC-as-a-service.  However, broader industry events covering AI in gaming, AR/MR development, or cloud computing might have featured presentations or discussions related to this area.\\n* **Strategic Partnerships:**  Potential significant events could have included strategic partnerships between AI companies and game developers or AR/MR platform providers to develop and deploy NPC-as-a-service solutions.\\n\\n\\n**4. Investment Trends:**\\n\\n* **Early-stage funding:**  Investment in this area was likely focused on early-stage startups developing the core technologies and platforms for NPC-as-a-service.  Venture capital and angel investors might have been the primary sources of funding.\\n* **Strategic acquisitions:**  Larger companies in the gaming or AR/MR space might have acquired smaller startups with promising NPC-as-a-service technology.\\n\\n\\n**5. Competitive Landscape Shifts:**\\n\\n* **Few established players:**  In 2020, the competitive landscape was likely fragmented, with many small startups competing.  There were probably few large, established players dominating the market.\\n* **Focus on differentiation:**  Companies likely focused on differentiating their offerings through unique AI capabilities, specialized game engine integrations, or targeted market segments (e.g., specific game genres or AR/MR applications).\\n\\n\\n**To find actual 2020 data:**\\n\\nYou would need to search for market research reports from firms like Gartner, IDC, Newzoo, or similar companies specializing in the gaming, AR/MR, and AI sectors.  Look for reports that specifically cover AI in gaming or cloud-based game development services. You might also find relevant information in industry publications and news archives from 2020.  Remember to critically evaluate the sources and their methodologies.\\n',\n",

In Platform-as-a-Service Market report data has been gathered from industry specialists/experts. Although the market size of the market is studied and predicted from 2020 to 2027 mulling over 2019 as the base year of the market study. Attentiveness for the market has increased in recent decades due to development and improvement in the innovation.\\n Platform-as-a-Service Market Statistics \\nPlatform-as-a-service (PaaS) is a cloud service delivery model in which third party cloud service providers deliver some hardware and software tools to those who are in need of complete development and deployment of applications over the internet. These service providers offer a platform, which allows customers to develop, run, and manage services without dealing with complex building and maintenance of infrastructure of developing an application. Thus, developers only need to install in-house hardware &amp; software to develop or run a new application. PaaS charge organizations only for compute, network resources consumed, and storage. It can be delivered through public, private, and hybrid clouds. Customers control software deployment while cloud providers deliver entire IT component needed to host the application. \\n Access Full Summery Report: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/platfor…ket-A06955  \\n COVID-19 scenario Analysis: \\nThe growing impact of the unpredicted pandemic on economy has hampered the functioning of several sectors, including technology, automation, banking and enterprise information.\\nFlexibility and agility of cloud solutions, ease of provisioning and scaling new resources, pay-per-use model, is a perfect fit for current uncertainty. The popularity of cloud solutions after these uncertain times provide lucrative opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market as working patterns are changing to remote working where possible, and where many interactions are moved to digital channels rather than physical channels to avoid or at least slow down the spread of the virus. \\nAs the adoption of cloud technology has increased in this time, adoption of PaaS has increased. It is expected that PaaS investments are expected to increase in number of industry verticals such as healthcare, information technology, and academic sector which boosts growth of the market \\nMany organizations have their digital to-do lists written for them, as weak links become apparent in this sudden shift to digital and remote working, the development of new applications and shift toward digitalization would create multiple opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\n Top impacting factors: Market Scenario Analysis, Trends, Drivers and Impact Analysis \\nAdoption of PaaS is on the rise among end users, owing to its numerous benefits such as cost reduction, less time consumption, and scalability; which majorly drives growth of the market. In addition, rise in adoption of cloud-based services, increase in use of internet of things, and rise in demand for application development platforms further fuel growth of the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\nHowever, factors such as less data security, integrations issues, and challenges with customization of legacy systems restraints the growth of the market. Furthermore, ongoing large investments by major IT vendors in the PaaS is opportunistic for the market.\\n Get sample report for more details: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-sample/7320  \\n Growth in need for PaaS  \\nMany organizations are expecting that with growth in digitalization, payments would create a cloud native environment and organizations would need to hire a 3rd party provider, which can use domestic, cross border, and regional payment solutions via a single interface.

       "     'question': 'WHats the market for NPC as an service? in AR, MR and gaming?',\n",
       "     'analysis': 'I cannot provide a comprehensive analysis of the market for \"NPC as a service\" in AR, MR, and gaming in 2021 based on actual search results.  This is because:\\n\\n1. **Data Scarcity:**  The phrase \"NPC as a service\" wasn\\'t a widely established or tracked market segment in 2021.  While the underlying technologies (AI, game development, AR/MR platforms) were active, the specific bundling of non-player characters as a service offering was nascent.  Therefore, there wouldn\\'t have been readily available market reports or comprehensive data from search engines.\\n\\n2. **Search Engine Limitations:** Search engines index what\\'s publicly available.  If the market was small and largely internal to companies, it wouldn\\'t show up prominently in search results.\\n\\n3. **Definition Ambiguity:** The term \"NPC as a service\" needs further clarification.  Does it refer to:\\n    * **Pre-built NPC assets:**  Companies selling ready-made NPC models, animations, and basic AI behaviors for game developers to integrate.\\n    * **NPC generation tools:**  Software or platforms that allow developers to easily create and customize NPCs with varying levels of AI.\\n    * **Backend NPC services:**  Cloud-based services that handle the complex computations and interactions of many NPCs in a game or AR/MR environment.\\n    * **Live NPC control:** Services that allow real-time control and manipulation of NPCs by human operators (e.g., for immersive experiences).\\n\\nTo perform a proper analysis, we\\'d need concrete market research data, which is unlikely to exist for such a niche area in 2021.\\n\\n**However, I can provide a speculative analysis based on the likely trends and developments of the constituent technologies in 2021:**\\n\\n**- Market Size and Growth (Speculative):**  The market in 2021 would have been very small, likely in the early stages of development.  Growth would have been limited but potentially rapid as the underlying technologies matured.\\n\\n**- Key Technological Developments (2021):**\\n\\n* **Advancements in AI:**  Significant progress was made in natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and deep learning, which are crucial for creating more realistic and believable NPC behavior.  This would have laid the groundwork for more sophisticated NPC-as-a-service offerings.\\n* **Game Engines and Development Tools:**  Game engines like Unity and Unreal Engine continued to improve their tools for creating and managing NPCs, potentially paving the way for easier integration of external NPC services.\\n* **Cloud Computing:** Cloud infrastructure became more powerful and accessible, making it feasible to host complex NPC AI and simulations in the cloud, a key component of \"NPC as a service.\"\\n* **AR/MR Development:** AR/MR platforms were still developing, but the increasing capabilities in spatial computing and object recognition were making more advanced NPC interactions in augmented and mixed reality environments possible.\\n\\n**- Major Market Events (Speculative):**  No major public market events specifically focused on \"NPC as a service\" likely occurred in 2021.  However, relevant events would have included game developer conferences (GDC), AI conferences, and AR/MR industry events where related technologies were showcased.\\n\\n**- Investment Trends (Speculative):**  Investment in AI, game development, and AR/MR technologies was strong in 2021.  While direct investment in \"NPC as a service\" companies may have been limited, funding in related areas would have indirectly supported the development of this potential market.\\n\\n**- Competitive Landscape Shifts (Speculative):** The competitive landscape would have been fragmented, with various companies focusing on different aspects of NPC technology.  Larger game studios may have been developing their own internal solutions, while smaller companies might have explored offering specific NPC-related services.\\n\\n\\n**In summary:**  While a precise market analysis for \"NPC as a service\" in 2021 is impossible without dedicated market research data from that time, the technological advancements of 2021 clearly laid the foundation for such a market to emerge and grow in subsequent years. To get a better picture of the current state of this market, you would need to search for more recent market reports focusing on AI-powered NPCs in games and AR/MR applications.\\n',\n",
       "     'raw_search_results': ['News Categories           \\n \\nGuest Post By \\nPawan Kumar\\nInformation Technology Markets\\n2020-12-24\\t\\n \\nThe Objective of the Platform-as-a-Service Market report is to depict the trends and upcoming for Platform-as-a-Service Industry over the forecast years. In Platform-as-a-Service Market report data has been gathered from industry specialists/experts. Although the market size of the market is studied and predicted from 2020 to 2027 mulling over 2019 as the base year of the market study. Attentiveness for the market has increased in recent decades due to development and improvement in the innovation.\\n Platform-as-a-Service Market Statistics \\nPlatform-as-a-service (PaaS) is a cloud service delivery model in which third party cloud service providers deliver some hardware and software tools to those who are in need of complete development and deployment of applications over the internet. These service providers offer a platform, which allows customers to develop, run, and manage services without dealing with complex building and maintenance of infrastructure of developing an application. Thus, developers only need to install in-house hardware &amp; software to develop or run a new application. PaaS charge organizations only for compute, network resources consumed, and storage. It can be delivered through public, private, and hybrid clouds. Customers control software deployment while cloud providers deliver entire IT component needed to host the application. \\n Access Full Summery Report: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/platfor…ket-A06955  \\n COVID-19 scenario Analysis: \\nThe growing impact of the unpredicted pandemic on economy has hampered the functioning of several sectors, including technology, automation, banking and enterprise information.\\nFlexibility and agility of cloud solutions, ease of provisioning and scaling new resources, pay-per-use model, is a perfect fit for current uncertainty. The popularity of cloud solutions after these uncertain times provide lucrative opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market as working patterns are changing to remote working where possible, and where many interactions are moved to digital channels rather than physical channels to avoid or at least slow down the spread of the virus. \\nAs the adoption of cloud technology has increased in this time, adoption of PaaS has increased. It is expected that PaaS investments are expected to increase in number of industry verticals such as healthcare, information technology, and academic sector which boosts growth of the market \\nMany organizations have their digital to-do lists written for them, as weak links become apparent in this sudden shift to digital and remote working, the development of new applications and shift toward digitalization would create multiple opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\n Top impacting factors: Market Scenario Analysis, Trends, Drivers and Impact Analysis \\nAdoption of PaaS is on the rise among end users, owing to its numerous benefits such as cost reduction, less time consumption, and scalability; which majorly drives growth of the market. In addition, rise in adoption of cloud-based services, increase in use of internet of things, and rise in demand for application development platforms further fuel growth of the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\nHowever, factors such as less data security, integrations issues, and challenges with customization of legacy systems restraints the growth of the market. Furthermore, ongoing large investments by major IT vendors in the PaaS is opportunistic for the market.\\n Get sample report for more details: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-sample/7320  \\n Growth in need for PaaS  \\nMany organizations are expecting that with growth in digitalization, payments would create a cloud native environment and organizations would need to hire a 3rd party provider, which can use domestic, cross border, and regional payment solutions via a single interface. In addition, providers would also manage complexities and difficulties associated with moving funds. Thus, it is expected that digitalization and online payment with new product launch would create multiple opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\n Dependency on vendor is a major concern:  \\nAs 3rd party providers fulfill most of the requirements for development and deployment of any program, this dependency is expected to act as restraining factor for growth of the market. As businesses are governed by provider’s functional capabilities, reliability and speed, any circumstance may occur resulting in data loss, which, in turn, hampers the growth of the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\n Inquiry more about this report: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/purchas…quiry/7320  \\n Key benefits of the report: \\nThis study presents analytical depiction of the global platform-as-a-service market along with the current trends and future estimations to determine the imminent investment pockets.\\nThe report presents information related to key drivers, restraints, and opportunities along with detailed analysis of the platform as a service market share.\\nThe current market is quantitatively analyzed from 2019 to 2027 to highlight the global platform-as-a-service market growth scenario.\\nPorter’s five forces analysis illustrates the potency of buyers &amp; suppliers in the market. \\nThe report provides detailed cognitive media market analysis based on competitive intensity and how the competition will take shape in coming years. \\n Regions Covered \\nNorth America (U.S. and Canada)\\nEurope (Germany, UK, France, and Rest of Europe)\\nAsia-Pacific (China, Japan, India, and Rest of Asia Pacific)\\nLAMEA (Latin America, Middle East, and Africa)\\n Companies Covered \\nMicrosoft Corp.\\nGoogle LLC.\\nAmazon Web Services Inc.\\nSalesforce.

       "     'question': 'WHats the market for NPC as an service? in AR, MR and gaming?',\n",
       "     'analysis': 'Analyzing the market for \"NPC as a Service\" (NPCaaS) in AR/MR and gaming in 2022 requires a nuanced approach because readily available, comprehensive market reports specifically on NPCaaS are scarce.  The concept itself is relatively new and often falls under broader categories like AI in gaming, cloud gaming services, or real-time 3D development platforms. Therefore, the analysis will be based on piecing together information from related market trends and news articles from 2022.\\n\\n**1. Market Size and Growth:**\\n\\n* **Difficult to Quantify Directly:**  No specific market size data for NPCaaS existed in 2022.  Estimating its size would require extrapolating from the overall growth of the AR/MR and gaming markets, and the increasing adoption of AI and cloud services within those sectors.\\n* **Indirect Indicators of Growth:**  The significant growth in the broader markets of AR/MR (augmented and mixed reality) and gaming, coupled with rising investments in AI and cloud-based game development tools, strongly suggests a nascent but growing market for NPCaaS.  The increasing demand for more realistic and engaging NPCs points towards increasing adoption.\\n* **Growth Drivers:**  Factors like the increasing sophistication of AI, the rise of cloud computing, and the growing demand for more immersive and personalized gaming experiences all contribute to potential NPCaaS market growth.\\n\\n\\n**2. Key Technological Developments:**\\n\\n* **Advances in AI:**  Progress in natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and deep learning facilitated the creation of more intelligent and believable NPCs.  This included advancements in behavior trees, decision-making algorithms, and emotion modeling.\\n* **Real-time 3D Technologies:**  Improvements in real-time rendering and physics engines allowed for more realistic NPC interactions within AR/MR and gaming environments.  This includes advancements in character animation, physics simulations, and procedural generation.\\n* **Cloud Computing Infrastructure:**  The expansion of cloud computing capabilities provided the necessary infrastructure for hosting and managing complex AI-powered NPCs, enabling scalability and accessibility for developers.\\n\\n\\n**3. Major Market Events (2022):**\\n\\n* **Limited Publicly Available Data:**  Specific events directly focused on the launch of significant NPCaaS platforms or major partnerships were not prominently reported in 2022.  Many developments likely occurred within individual companies.\\n* **Industry Conferences and Announcements:**  News from larger gaming and technology conferences (like GDC, SIGGRAPH, etc.) likely contained mentions of AI advancements relevant to NPC development, but not always explicitly framed as \"NPCaaS.\"  Look for presentations on AI-driven game design and character development.\\n* **Game Releases:**  The release of major games featuring advanced AI-driven NPCs could be considered indirect market events, showcasing the potential of NPCaaS.  Analyze the marketing materials and developer discussions of successful AAA titles.\\n\\n\\n**4. Investment Trends:**\\n\\n* **Venture Capital and Private Equity:**  Investment in AI and cloud gaming companies indirectly supported the development of NPCaaS technologies.  Many venture capital firms focused on AI and gaming likely invested in companies that implicitly developed or utilized NPCaaS capabilities.  Searching for investment news in related sectors is necessary.\\n* **Strategic Acquisitions:**  Large game developers or technology companies may have acquired smaller firms specializing in AI-driven NPC technologies.  This would indicate a strategic move towards incorporating NPCaaS into their products and services.\\n\\n\\n**5. Competitive Landscape Shifts:**\\n\\n* **Emerging Players:**  Several smaller companies likely emerged, offering specialized NPCaaS solutions or development tools.  Identifying them would require extensive research into game development communities and industry news.\\n* **Large Tech Companies:**  Major cloud providers (like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) and game engine developers (like Unity, Unreal Engine) likely offered services that indirectly supported NPCaaS, potentially increasing competition in the space.\\n* **Open-Source Contributions:**  Open-source projects related to AI and game development contributed to the overall technological advancement, influencing the competitive landscape.\\n\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\n\\nIn 2022, the NPCaaS market was in its early stages. While no precise market size or detailed competitive landscape was readily available, the significant growth in related fields (AI, cloud computing, AR/MR, and gaming) strongly suggests a developing market with significant potential.  Further research would involve analyzing individual company announcements, investment reports focusing on AI in gaming, and monitoring the evolution of relevant technologies within game development.  The lack of dedicated NPCaaS market reports highlights the nascent nature of this specific market segment.\\n',\n",

       "      'News Categories           \\n \\nGuest Post By \\nPawan Kumar\\nInformation Technology Markets\\n2020-12-24\\t\\n \\nThe Objective of the Platform-as-a-Service Market report is to depict the trends and upcoming for Platform-as-a-Service Industry over the forecast years. In Platform-as-a-Service Market report data has been gathered from industry specialists/experts. Although the market size of the market is studied and predicted from 2020 to 2027 mulling over 2019 as the base year of the market study. Attentiveness for the market has increased in recent decades due to development and improvement in the innovation.\\n Platform-as-a-Service Market Statistics \\nPlatform-as-a-service (PaaS) is a cloud service delivery model in which third party cloud service providers deliver some hardware and software tools to those who are in need of complete development and deployment of applications over the internet. These service providers offer a platform, which allows customers to develop, run, and manage services without dealing with complex building and maintenance of infrastructure of developing an application. Thus, developers only need to install in-house hardware &amp; software to develop or run a new application. PaaS charge organizations only for compute, network resources consumed, and storage. It can be delivered through public, private, and hybrid clouds. Customers control software deployment while cloud providers deliver entire IT component needed to host the application. \\n Access Full Summery Report: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/platfor…ket-A06955  \\n COVID-19 scenario Analysis: \\nThe growing impact of the unpredicted pandemic on economy has hampered the functioning of several sectors, including technology, automation, banking and enterprise information.\\nFlexibility and agility of cloud solutions, ease of provisioning and scaling new resources, pay-per-use model, is a perfect fit for current uncertainty. The popularity of cloud solutions after these uncertain times provide lucrative opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market as working patterns are changing to remote working where possible, and where many interactions are moved to digital channels rather than physical channels to avoid or at least slow down the spread of the virus. \\nAs the adoption of cloud technology has increased in this time, adoption of PaaS has increased. It is expected that PaaS investments are expected to increase in number of industry verticals such as healthcare, information technology, and academic sector which boosts growth of the market \\nMany organizations have their digital to-do lists written for them, as weak links become apparent in this sudden shift to digital and remote working, the development of new applications and shift toward digitalization would create multiple opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\n Top impacting factors: Market Scenario Analysis, Trends, Drivers and Impact Analysis \\nAdoption of PaaS is on the rise among end users, owing to its numerous benefits such as cost reduction, less time consumption, and scalability; which majorly drives growth of the market. In addition, rise in adoption of cloud-based services, increase in use of internet of things, and rise in demand for application development platforms further fuel growth of the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\nHowever, factors such as less data security, integrations issues, and challenges with customization of legacy systems restraints the growth of the market. Furthermore, ongoing large investments by major IT vendors in the PaaS is opportunistic for the market.\\n Get sample report for more details: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-sample/7320  \\n Growth in need for PaaS  \\nMany organizations are expecting that with growth in digitalization, payments would create a cloud native environment and organizations would need to hire a 3rd party provider, which can use domestic, cross border, and regional payment solutions via a single interface. In addition, providers would also manage complexities and difficulties associated with moving funds. Thus, it is expected that digitalization and online payment with new product launch would create multiple opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\n Dependency on vendor is a major concern:  \\nAs 3rd party providers fulfill most of the requirements for development and deployment of any program, this dependency is expected to act as restraining factor for growth of the market. As businesses are governed by provider’s functional capabilities, reliability and speed, any circumstance may occur resulting in data loss, which, in turn, hampers the growth of the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\n Inquiry more about this report: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/purchas…quiry/7320  \\n Key benefits of the report: \\nThis study presents analytical depiction of the global platform-as-a-service market along with the current trends and future estimations to determine the imminent investment pockets.\\nThe report presents information related to key drivers, restraints, and opportunities along with detailed analysis of the platform as a service market share.\\nThe current market is quantitatively analyzed from 2019 to 2027 to highlight the global platform-as-a-service market growth scenario.\\nPorter’s five forces analysis illustrates the potency of buyers &amp; suppliers in the market. \\nThe report provides detailed cognitive media market analysis based on competitive intensity and how the competition will take shape in coming years. \\n Regions Covered \\nNorth America (U.S. and Canada)\\nEurope (Germany, UK, France, and Rest of Europe)\\nAsia-Pacific (China, Japan, India, and Rest of Asia Pacific)\\nLAMEA (Latin America, Middle East, and Africa)\\n Companies Covered \\nMicrosoft Corp.\\nGoogle LLC.\\nAmazon Web Services Inc.\\nSalesforce.

       "     'question': 'WHats the market for NPC as an service? in AR, MR and gaming?',\n",
       "     'analysis': 'Analyzing the market for \"NPC as a service (NPaaS)\" in AR, MR, and gaming in 2023 requires a nuanced approach because readily available, comprehensive market reports specifically on this niche segment are scarce.  The term itself isn\\'t widely standardized, and the market is likely bundled within broader categories like AI in gaming, AR/MR development tools, or cloud-based game development services.  Therefore, this analysis will be based on inferential reasoning from related market trends.\\n\\n\\n**1. Market Size and Growth:**\\n\\n* **Indirect Estimation:**  We can estimate the market size indirectly. The overall market for AR/MR and gaming is substantial and growing rapidly.  The market for AI and machine learning in gaming, a key component of realistic and engaging NPCs, is also experiencing significant growth.  A portion of the spending in these broader categories can be attributed to NPaaS, but quantifying that portion precisely is challenging without dedicated market research.  Reports on AI in gaming or cloud gaming services provide a helpful, albeit broad, context.\\n\\n* **Growth Drivers:** Several factors drive growth:\\n    * **Increased Realism:** Gamers demand more realistic and engaging NPCs, pushing the need for advanced AI and NPaaS solutions.\\n    * **Reduced Development Costs:** NPaaS can significantly reduce development time and costs for game developers, making it attractive for smaller studios and indie developers.\\n    * **Scalability:** Cloud-based NPaaS solutions offer scalability, allowing developers to easily adjust the number and complexity of NPCs based on demand.\\n    * **AR/MR Expansion:**  The growing adoption of AR/MR technologies opens up new avenues for NPaaS, creating interactive experiences beyond traditional gaming.\\n\\n* **Growth Challenges:**\\n    * **Technological Limitations:**  Creating truly intelligent and believable NPCs remains a challenge.  Current AI may struggle with complex interactions and unpredictable player behavior.\\n    * **Data Requirements:**  Training sophisticated NPC AI requires vast amounts of data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to acquire.\\n    * **Security Concerns:**  Cloud-based NPaaS solutions raise concerns about data security and the potential for exploits.\\n\\n\\n**2. Key Technological Developments:**\\n\\n* **Advancements in AI:**  Improvements in natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and deep learning are crucial for enhancing NPC behavior and creating more realistic dialogue and interactions.  Specific advancements in reinforcement learning and generative AI are particularly relevant.\\n\\n* **Cloud Computing Infrastructure:**  The development of more powerful and affordable cloud computing platforms is essential for supporting the computational demands of complex NPC AI.  Edge computing solutions are also becoming increasingly important for reducing latency in AR/MR applications.\\n\\n* **Game Engines and Development Tools:**  Game engines (Unity, Unreal Engine) are constantly evolving to better integrate AI and provide tools for managing and deploying NPaaS solutions.\\n\\n\\n**3. Major Market Events:**\\n\\n* **Lack of Specific Events:** There haven\\'t been any singular, highly publicized \"market events\" specifically focused on NPaaS. However, major game releases featuring highly advanced NPCs, or announcements from large tech companies integrating AI into their gaming platforms, indirectly signal progress in this area.  Keep an eye on industry conferences like GDC (Game Developers Conference) and industry news for relevant announcements.\\n\\n\\n**4. Investment Trends:**\\n\\n* **Venture Capital and Private Equity:**  Investment in AI and gaming is high, with a significant portion likely flowing into companies developing advanced NPC technologies, even if not explicitly labeled as \"NPaaS.\"  Tracking investments in AI-focused gaming studios or companies specializing in game development tools will provide insights.\\n\\n* **Strategic Acquisitions:**  Large game publishers and technology companies are likely to acquire smaller companies specializing in NPC AI to strengthen their capabilities.\\n\\n\\n**5. Competitive Landscape Shifts:**\\n\\n* **Emerging Players:** Smaller startups and independent developers are likely leading innovation in NPaaS, often focusing on specific niches within AR/MR or gaming genres.\\n\\n* **Established Players:**  Large tech companies (Google, Microsoft, Amazon) and game publishers are increasingly integrating AI into their platforms and games, indirectly competing in the NPaaS space.  Their focus is often on broader AI integration, not a dedicated NPaaS offering.\\n\\n* **Open-Source Initiatives:**  Open-source AI projects and libraries are contributing to the development of NPaaS technologies, fostering collaboration and innovation.\\n\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\n\\nThe market for NPC as a service is nascent but holds significant potential.  Its growth is intrinsically linked to the broader growth of AI, AR/MR, and the gaming industry. Due to the lack of precise market data, continuous monitoring of related market segments, technological advancements, and investment activity is crucial to understand the evolving landscape of NPaaS.  Future research should focus on defining clearer market boundaries and conducting dedicated market research to provide more accurate size and growth projections.\\n',\n",

These service providers offer a platform, which allows customers to develop, run, and manage services without dealing with complex building and maintenance of infrastructure of developing an application. Thus, developers only need to install in-house hardware &amp; software to develop or run a new application. PaaS charge organizations only for compute, network resources consumed, and storage. It can be delivered through public, private, and hybrid clouds. Customers control software deployment while cloud providers deliver entire IT component needed to host the application. \\n Access Full Summery Report: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/platfor…ket-A06955  \\n COVID-19 scenario Analysis: \\nThe growing impact of the unpredicted pandemic on economy has hampered the functioning of several sectors, including technology, automation, banking and enterprise information.\\nFlexibility and agility of cloud solutions, ease of provisioning and scaling new resources, pay-per-use model, is a perfect fit for current uncertainty. The popularity of cloud solutions after these uncertain times provide lucrative opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market as working patterns are changing to remote working where possible, and where many interactions are moved to digital channels rather than physical channels to avoid or at least slow down the spread of the virus. \\nAs the adoption of cloud technology has increased in this time, adoption of PaaS has increased. It is expected that PaaS investments are expected to increase in number of industry verticals such as healthcare, information technology, and academic sector which boosts growth of the market \\nMany organizations have their digital to-do lists written for them, as weak links become apparent in this sudden shift to digital and remote working, the development of new applications and shift toward digitalization would create multiple opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\n Top impacting factors: Market Scenario Analysis, Trends, Drivers and Impact Analysis \\nAdoption of PaaS is on the rise among end users, owing to its numerous benefits such as cost reduction, less time consumption, and scalability; which majorly drives growth of the market. In addition, rise in adoption of cloud-based services, increase in use of internet of things, and rise in demand for application development platforms further fuel growth of the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\nHowever, factors such as less data security, integrations issues, and challenges with customization of legacy systems restraints the growth of the market. Furthermore, ongoing large investments by major IT vendors in the PaaS is opportunistic for the market.\\n Get sample report for more details: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-sample/7320  \\n Growth in need for PaaS  \\nMany organizations are expecting that with growth in digitalization, payments would create a cloud native environment and organizations would need to hire a 3rd party provider, which can use domestic, cross border, and regional payment solutions via a single interface. In addition, providers would also manage complexities and difficulties associated with moving funds. Thus, it is expected that digitalization and online payment with new product launch would create multiple opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\n Dependency on vendor is a major concern:  \\nAs 3rd party providers fulfill most of the requirements for development and deployment of any program, this dependency is expected to act as restraining factor for growth of the market. As businesses are governed by provider’s functional capabilities, reliability and speed, any circumstance may occur resulting in data loss, which, in turn, hampers the growth of the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\n Inquiry more about this report: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/purchas…quiry/7320  \\n Key benefits of the report: \\nThis study presents analytical depiction of the global platform-as-a-service market along with the current trends and future estimations to determine the imminent investment pockets.\\nThe report presents information related to key drivers, restraints, and opportunities along with detailed analysis of the platform as a service market share.\\nThe current market is quantitatively analyzed from 2019 to 2027 to highlight the global platform-as-a-service market growth scenario.\\nPorter’s five forces analysis illustrates the potency of buyers &amp; suppliers in the market. \\nThe report provides detailed cognitive media market analysis based on competitive intensity and how the competition will take shape in coming years. \\n Regions Covered \\nNorth America (U.S. and Canada)\\nEurope (Germany, UK, France, and Rest of Europe)\\nAsia-Pacific (China, Japan, India, and Rest of Asia Pacific)\\nLAMEA (Latin America, Middle East, and Africa)\\n Companies Covered \\nMicrosoft Corp.\\nGoogle LLC.\\nAmazon Web Services Inc.\\nSalesforce.

This will be driven by the potential of the underlying technology and the demand from game and AR/MR developers.\\n\\n* **Strategic Partnerships:**  Larger game studios and AR/MR companies might partner with AI specialists to integrate advanced NPC technologies into their products.\\n\\n* **API and SDK Releases:**  The emergence of readily available APIs and SDKs (Software Development Kits) will be a key market event, making it easier for developers to incorporate NPC-as-a-service into their projects.  This will accelerate adoption.\\n\\n* **Industry Conferences and Presentations:**  Discussions and demonstrations of NPC-as-a-service solutions at gaming and AR/MR industry conferences will help shape the market\\'s trajectory.\\n\\n\\n**4. Investment Trends:**\\n\\n* **Focus on AI-driven NPCs:**  Investors will likely prioritize companies developing advanced AI-driven NPCs over simpler, rule-based alternatives.  The potential for creating truly immersive and engaging experiences will drive investment decisions.\\n\\n* **Cross-platform compatibility:**  Investment will favor solutions compatible with multiple platforms (PC, mobile, consoles, AR/VR headsets) to broaden the market reach.\\n\\n* **Scalability and efficiency:**  Efficient and scalable platforms that can handle a large number of concurrent NPCs will be attractive to investors.\\n\\n\\n**5. Competitive Landscape Shifts:**\\n\\n* **Emergence of specialized platforms:**  We expect to see the emergence of specialized platforms offering NPC-as-a-service tailored to specific needs (e.g., a platform for realistic dialogue, another for complex behavior modeling).\\n\\n* **Consolidation:**  As the market matures, there might be consolidation through mergers and acquisitions, with larger companies acquiring smaller startups to gain a competitive edge.\\n\\n* **Open-source vs. proprietary solutions:**  The availability of open-source tools and platforms might influence the competitive landscape, potentially fostering innovation and reducing the barrier to entry for smaller developers.\\n\\n\\n**In summary:** The \"NPC as a service\" market is nascent but holds immense potential. Its growth will be closely tied to the advancements in AI, cloud computing, and the overall expansion of the AR/MR and gaming industries. While precise market size data is currently unavailable, the market is expected to show substantial growth in the coming years.  Tracking industry news, venture capital funding announcements, and the release of new platforms and tools will provide the best insights into the evolving competitive landscape.\\n',\n",
       "     'raw_search_results': ['News Categories           \\n \\nGuest Post By \\nPawan Kumar\\nInformation Technology Markets\\n2020-12-24\\t\\n \\nThe Objective of the Platform-as-a-Service Market report is to depict the trends and upcoming for Platform-as-a-Service Industry over the forecast years. In Platform-as-a-Service Market report data has been gathered from industry specialists/experts. Although the market size of the market is studied and predicted from 2020 to 2027 mulling over 2019 as the base year of the market study. Attentiveness for the market has increased in recent decades due to development and improvement in the innovation.\\n Platform-as-a-Service Market Statistics \\nPlatform-as-a-service (PaaS) is a cloud service delivery model in which third party cloud service providers deliver some hardware and software tools to those who are in need of complete development and deployment of applications over the internet. These service providers offer a platform, which allows customers to develop, run, and manage services without dealing with complex building and maintenance of infrastructure of developing an application. Thus, developers only need to install in-house hardware &amp; software to develop or run a new application. PaaS charge organizations only for compute, network resources consumed, and storage. It can be delivered through public, private, and hybrid clouds. Customers control software deployment while cloud providers deliver entire IT component needed to host the application. \\n Access Full Summery Report: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/platfor…ket-A06955  \\n COVID-19 scenario Analysis: \\nThe growing impact of the unpredicted pandemic on economy has hampered the functioning of several sectors, including technology, automation, banking and enterprise information.\\nFlexibility and agility of cloud solutions, ease of provisioning and scaling new resources, pay-per-use model, is a perfect fit for current uncertainty. The popularity of cloud solutions after these uncertain times provide lucrative opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market as working patterns are changing to remote working where possible, and where many interactions are moved to digital channels rather than physical channels to avoid or at least slow down the spread of the virus. \\nAs the adoption of cloud technology has increased in this time, adoption of PaaS has increased. It is expected that PaaS investments are expected to increase in number of industry verticals such as healthcare, information technology, and academic sector which boosts growth of the market \\nMany organizations have their digital to-do lists written for them, as weak links become apparent in this sudden shift to digital and remote working, the development of new applications and shift toward digitalization would create multiple opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\n Top impacting factors: Market Scenario Analysis, Trends, Drivers and Impact Analysis \\nAdoption of PaaS is on the rise among end users, owing to its numerous benefits such as cost reduction, less time consumption, and scalability; which majorly drives growth of the market. In addition, rise in adoption of cloud-based services, increase in use of internet of things, and rise in demand for application development platforms further fuel growth of the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\nHowever, factors such as less data security, integrations issues, and challenges with customization of legacy systems restraints the growth of the market. Furthermore, ongoing large investments by major IT vendors in the PaaS is opportunistic for the market.\\n Get sample report for more details: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-sample/7320  \\n Growth in need for PaaS  \\nMany organizations are expecting that with growth in digitalization, payments would create a cloud native environment and organizations would need to hire a 3rd party provider, which can use domestic, cross border, and regional payment solutions via a single interface. In addition, providers would also manage complexities and difficulties associated with moving funds. Thus, it is expected that digitalization and online payment with new product launch would create multiple opportunities for the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\n Dependency on vendor is a major concern:  \\nAs 3rd party providers fulfill most of the requirements for development and deployment of any program, this dependency is expected to act as restraining factor for growth of the market. As businesses are governed by provider’s functional capabilities, reliability and speed, any circumstance may occur resulting in data loss, which, in turn, hampers the growth of the Platform-as-a-Service market. \\n Inquiry more about this report: www.alliedmarketresearch.com/purchas…quiry/7320  \\n Key benefits of the report: \\nThis study presents analytical depiction of the global platform-as-a-service market along with the current trends and future estimations to determine the imminent investment pockets.\\nThe report presents information related to key drivers, restraints, and opportunities along with detailed analysis of the platform as a service market share.\\nThe current market is quantitatively analyzed from 2019 to 2027 to highlight the global platform-as-a-service market growth scenario.\\nPorter’s five forces analysis illustrates the potency of buyers &amp; suppliers in the market. \\nThe report provides detailed cognitive media market analysis based on competitive intensity and how the competition will take shape in coming years. \\n Regions Covered \\nNorth America (U.S. and Canada)\\nEurope (Germany, UK, France, and Rest of Europe)\\nAsia-Pacific (China, Japan, India, and Rest of Asia Pacific)\\nLAMEA (Latin America, Middle East, and Africa)\\n Companies Covered \\nMicrosoft Corp.\\nGoogle LLC.\\nAmazon Web Services Inc.\\nSalesforce.

       "    \"Looking for the best search engines other than Google? Perhaps you’re concerned about privacy, want to help the environment, or you’re just keen to try something new.  It’s clear that Google is the most popular search engine. Statcounter shows that Google has had a global market share of around (or above) 90% since the site started recording data in 2009.  But Google may not be the best choice all of the time. In the list below, you’ll find the best alternative search engines ordered by category.  Mainstream Search Engines 1. Bing    Bing is the second-largest search engine in the world by market share. Launched by Microsoft in 2009, Bing is Google’s main competitor with a market share of 3.38% as of January 2024. As Microsoft is an investor in OpenAI (the company behind ChatGPT), Bing benefits from cutting-edge AI technology.  Microsoft updated Bing in February 2023 to include more AI features (calling it “the new Bing”). Like AI summaries and interactive AI chat.  Why It Stands Out Bing stands out for a few reasons:    Rewards program: Bing searches can earn you points for gift cards and charitable donations  Content generation: When you need more than a simple answer, Bing can generate content. Like an email, an essay, a poem, or an itinerary for a trip. Bing cites all its sources, so you can see the content it references too.  Visual experience: Bing’s layout is highly visual, with lots of imagery and other non-text elements    Further reading:  Bing vs. Google: Comparing the Two Search Engines   2. Yahoo    Yahoo is the third most popular search engine, with a market share of 1.13% in January 2024. Launched in 1994, Yahoo was one of the first search engines on the internet. It uses Microsoft's Bing to power its search function. So, the results are often similar. Yahoo is more than just a search engine. It’s an extensive web portal. It covers content on almost every topic, from the weather to news and finance\\u200b\\u200b. It also offers email services.  Why It Stands Out Yahoo’s homepage is informative and personalized. It shows you the weather for your location, top news stories, and even sports scores directly on the homepage. So you can see some basic (personalized) information before you even perform a search.  3. AOL    AOL is a web portal and search engine owned by Yahoo. It includes web, image, video, shopping, and map searching options. AOL uses Bing to produce search results. However, it has its own map search system, having acquired MapQuest in 2000.  AOL used to be a bigger player, with 1.45% market share in the USA back in early 2009. That share has shrunk to less than 0.2% in 2024. Why It Stands Out Like Yahoo, AOL’s homepage is a content portal. It contains links to articles on a wide range of topics. Like business, fitness, finance, news, recipes, and more. Privacy-Focused Search Engines 4. DuckDuckGo   Founded in 2008, DuckDuckGo is one of the best alternatives to Google if privacy and data security are important to you.  Powering 3 billion monthly searches, it caters to a growing audience concerned about their data being tracked and used for marketing purposes.  Unlike traditional search engines, DuckDuckGo doesn't track users or personalize ads. Your search history remains private.  It offers a familiar layout to Google. With categories like images, videos, news, maps, and shopping.  Why It Stands Out DuckDuckGo has a few stand-out features:   Bangs: These shortcuts enable quick access to search results on other sites, like Wikipedia or Amazon (you can access these by typing “!” into the search bar)  Instant Answers: Quick responses for a variety of queries including stock market updates, sports scores, song lyrics, and unit conversions  Private Voice Search: A secure voice search option for iOS users   5. Startpage   If you’re interested in search engines other than Google that don't track you, Startpage is another one to consider. Startpage describes itself as “the world's most private search engine.” The search engine was launched in 2006 in the Netherlands. It delivers Google's search results without tracking users’ search history\\u200b\\u200b. It does not record personal data or profile its users. And it removes user IP addresses from Startpage's servers. While it does deliver ads, it does not use behavioral targeting to do so. Search results include private local in-map results, knowledge panels, and instant answers. Users can tap into results from Google Images, Videos, News, and Shopping (this feature is currently in Beta).  Why It Stands Out It provides Google search results without tracking, combining Google's search power with enhanced privacy.  6. Brave    Brave is a web browser and search engine known for its strong focus on privacy and speed. It does not track users or their searches. Brave Search was launched in 2021. According to Brave's website, Brave Search has grown faster than any search provider since Bing, driving 2.5 million queries in the first year. Private, independent, and transparent, Brave Search is a viable alternative to Google.  And unlike many other privacy-focused search engines, it does not rely on Google and Microsoft to supply the search results. Brave delivers search results based on its own index.  To avoid bias, it won’t personalize your search results. For example, results won’t be impacted by your search history.  Why It Stands Out Key highlights of Brave include:   Transparency in ranking: Brave is transparent about how it ranks search results—it uses community feedback to refine search results and ensure diversity  Goggles feature: These allow you to apply custom filters and rules to tweak the way Brave ranks results for you  AI-powered summarizer: Provides concise, AI-generated summaries at the top of search results with cited sources  7. Qwant    Qwant is a privacy-focused search engine from France. It is available in several languages, including English and Italian. On the search engine's website, Qwant claims to have 6 million monthly users and process 7 million queries each day.  Qwant offers three main interfaces: Search, Maps, and Qwant Junior (available in French).  Qwant uses Bing to deliver search results. According to an article written by Qwant, the search engine is continually evolving to use more of its own systems and become truly independent.  When you conduct a Qwant search, your search queries are encrypted. So other websites and third-party networks won’t find out who you are and what you are searching for.  That said, Qwant is a close partner of Microsoft, and Bing Ads are displayed in the search results. Qwant shares some of the ad data it collects with Microsoft.  Why It Stands Out Qwant takes privacy seriously and even describes itself as “the search engine that doesn't know anything about you.”  8. Swisscows    Swisscows is an anonymous search engine that aims to be family-friendly. It doesn't track users, store data, or use cookies.  The search engine’s privacy policy states that it tracks some data to monitor traffic and block bots. But after seven days, Swisscows removes all personal information (like your IP address) from the search data. Unlike some other privacy-focused search engines, it filters inappropriate content. So it’s safe for all ages. Swisscows cooperates closely with Microsoft. Bing powers its search results (although it does have its own index for German language queries), and it earns revenue through Bing Ads.  Why It Stands Out Swisscows is based in Switzerland (hence the name), and Switzerland has a long history of privacy and security. Its laws are generally protective of individual privacy rights. In fact, Swisscows says its “technology is built in such a way that the storage of user data is not even possible.” 9. Gibiru    Gibiru is another alternative search engine with a focus on privacy. Founded in 2009, it offers an anonymous and uncensored search experience. Gibiru does not record searches, track IP addresses, or place cookies on your computer for advertisers to target you.  As well as standard search, it also offers images, videos, and news options. Gibiru appears to use a modified version of Google’s algorithm for ranking results and may show content that is censored by other search engines. At the top of the search results, you can toggle between “All Results” and “Censored Content.” Like some forum threads. Why It Stands Out It’s a highly privacy-focused search engine that can deliver search results you might not be able to find on Google. Search Engines with Generative AI 10. You.com    You.com is an AI-based search engine. It aims to make users’ lives easier by summarizing the web.  You can search in natural language to get an AI-generated summary. But if you need more info, you can click on “All” in the top navigation bar to see a list of search results. Like a traditional search engine. The AI assistant can answer questions and explain concepts, suggest ideas, translate content, and even write code. Users can choose between private mode (with zero data collection) and personal mode (which is more customized).  In personal mode, you can also define your preferred sources to see results from the sources you trust first. To save you time when searching. If you haven’t set your personal preferences, rankings are based on relevancy. The search engine relies on Bing for its search results, although it does have its own website crawler. You.com is highly privacy-focused, aiming to store the minimum amount of data possible. And You.com does not sell your data to advertisers or use external trackers.  You.com is currently only available in English and primarily serves the U.S. market.  Why It Stands Out You.com offers AI-powered tools like Imagine (for image generation) and YouWrite (text generation)\\u200b\\u200b. These can help you with creative tasks if you need more than just a search engine results page (SERP).  11. Perplexity AI    Perplexity.ai is an AI-driven search engine focused on providing direct answers to questions.  It uses advanced AI models to understand and respond to user queries. The search engine is designed to deliver precise, context-aware answers. Unlike traditional search engines that primarily just list web pages. The interface is simple and user-friendly, designed to make information easily accessible. And it cites sources so you can verify the information. If you sign up, you can read your previous chats in a library. You can also hit the toggle button next to the search bar to activate Copilot.  Copilot is a smart assistant that asks you follow-up questions and suggests your next query.  There is a paid pro version available that includes image upload, upgraded AI, and more Copilot searches. Why It Stands Out Perplexity makes it easy to find the information you need, quickly, using AI. 12. Komo    Komo is an AI-driven search engine that focuses on speed and privacy. You can use it to research topics, ask it to explain a concept, or catch up with news.  Komo uses machine learning to analyze information from various online sources. Then, it provides an AI-generated summary with a list of sources. And suggests follow-up questions. The experience is more interactive than a traditional search engine. Because you can ask Komo follow up questions.  Why It Stands Out Komo’s AI summaries give you accurate and detailed responses to a query without needing to browse different sites. This is similar to Google Search Generative Experience (SGE).  Search Engines That Support the Environment 13. Ecosia     Ecosia is a Berlin-based search engine that dedicates 100% of its profits to saving the planet.  With 20 million users, it uses ad revenue from searches to fund tree planting and conservation projects globally.  When you search, you can see an icon on the top right that tells you how many trees you've planted with Ecosia. The more you search, the more trees Ecosia plants. The search interface resembles Google, with image, news, video, and map searching options. It also offers rich results, where you can search train times or book a hotel through Ecosia’s partners.  Ecosia’s results highlight eco-friendly organizations with a green leaf icon and “climate-destructive” companies with a fossil fuel plant icon, to help people make eco-conscious decisions.  It uses Bing and Google for search results and ads, but this can vary depending on your consent options. It also has a new AI chatbot powered by ChatGPT. Why It Stands Out As a carbon-negative company, Ecosia is a great choice for those who want to support the planet.According to Ecosia's blog, each search removes around 0.5kg of CO2 from the atmosphere.  14. giveWater    giveWater, founded by Michael Feeley, is a search engine that supports global water initiatives.  According to giveWater's website, 663 million people drink dirty water. This search engine is trying to change that. Users contribute to this cause by using giveWater for searches and clicking ads, with a portion of ad revenue going to water charities. There is also a giveWater browser extension for Chrome. Why It Stands Out With giveWater, you can help provide clean water to those who need it—just by searching the web. 15. Ekoru    Ekoru is a charity-led search engine that contributes to cleaning up the oceans.  Ekoru helps replant ocean seagrass and remove plastic. It does that by working with organizations like Big Blue Ocean Cleanup and Operation Posidonia. Searches are eco-friendly because Ekoru’s servers are powered by hydroelectricity (water-powered electricity). In fact, the company says a search on Ekoru generates 4.4g less CO2 than a search on Google.  It also encrypts your data and doesn't store or sell your search data to third parties. Why It Stands Out When you click on an ad, some revenue goes toward charities that help keep our oceans clean, rescue marine animals, and conduct research on the levels of microplastics. Ekoru’s efforts to reforest the ocean with seagrass can play a key role in fighting climate change.  16. Dogpile   If you’d like to access search results from a range of different search engines, Dogpile might be the right choice for you.  Dogpile uses metasearch technology. This means it combines results from other major search engine indexes, including Google and Bing. So you can perform a single search to get the most relevant results from around the web. To search on Dogpile, just type in what you’re looking for and click “Go Fetch!” Its “Are you looking for?” feature lists suggestions for your next search.  Why It Stands Out You can access search results from different search engines in one set of results. Plus, Dogpile is a hit for canine lovers. Dogpile has a mascot called Arfie the Dalmation who “fetches” the information. It displays the most popular “fetches” (searches) on its homepage.  Web3 Search Engine 17. Presearch    Presearch is a decentralized, community-powered search engine. It prioritizes privacy and rewards users with cryptocurrency. As Presearch is decentralized, it runs on servers operated by the community. Whereas search engines like Google run on the company’s own (centralized) servers.  Presearch’s vision is to build open and transparent algorithms so the community can contribute to the search index.  The search engine prioritizes privacy. User searches are not tracked, and you can choose if you want your search experience to be personalized or not.  Why It Stands Out Users can earn rewards for searching, staking (holding cryptocurrency), and referring others to the platform. Search Engine for Supporting a Good Cause 18. Goodsearch   Want to make the world a better place while you search? Goodsearch might be the alternative to Google that you’ve been looking for.  Goodsearch donates half its revenue (about a penny per search) to charities chosen by users. As of January 2024, Goodsearch has raised over $8 million. How does it work? Every time someone clicks on an ad, this generates some revenue. Which can go to more than 100,000 non-profit organizations. Such as schools, charities, hospitals, volunteer services, political and religious organizations, and more. The search interface will probably look familiar. You can find search, images, video, news, local, and shopping options. And the people also ask and related searches sections are similar to those found on Google. The search engine’s results are powered by Yahoo (which relies on Bing).  Why It Stands Out Goodsearch puts a strong focus on helping various communities through donations. This makes it a charitable alternative to Google search. Copyright-Free Search Engine  19. Creative Commons Search   Let’s say you need an image for a piece of content. So you look on Google Images and find something suitable.  But wait!  The image is copyrighted, so you can’t use it.  Luckily, there is another way.  You can use the Creative Commons search portal to find content you can use.  It includes Openverse, which gives you access to over 700 million free and openly licensed images, photos, audio, and other media types. You can also search through other platforms like Vimeo for videos and SoundCloud for music.  Why It Stands Out You can find copyright-free content for your own use. So it’s easy to find high-quality images, videos, and even audio for your own projects without worrying about the usage rights. International Search Engines 20. Yandex    Yandex is the most popular search engine in Russia. It’s also used in other countries like Belarus, Kazakhstan, Turkey, and Ukraine.  The appearance is quite minimalistic, but Yandex offers a wide range of services similar to Google. Like search, images, videos, maps, mail, and translation.  Why It Stands Out You can decide whether you want Yandex to personalize your experience or not. And you can even turn ads off from the homepage if you want to.  21. Baidu    Baidu is the leading Chinese search engine. It dominates around 66% of the search market in China as of January 2024. And the Baidu App is the number one search and information app in China. Baidu offers a broad range of services, including maps, music, videos, and an app store, similar to Google's range of services.

       "    'Ultimate Guide to Google Search Operators and Parameters\\nAdvanced search operators can be entered directly into the Google search box to refine your search. Search parameters can be used to construct your own search strings by typing them into the address bar, also called the Chrome omnibar.\\nA search operator might look like: \\nallintitle: tesla vs edison\\n \\nA search parameter might look like:\\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=\"nikola+tesla\"\\n \\nWhat are Google search operators?\\nGoogle search operators are special characters and commands sometimes called “advanced operators” or search parameters that extend the capabilities of regular text searches. Search operators can be useful for everything from content research to technical SEO audits.\\nHow do I use search operators?\\nYou can enter search operators directly into the Google search box, just as you would a text search:\\n \\nExcept in special cases (such as the “in” operator), Google will return standard organic results.\\nGoogle search operators cheat sheet\\nYou can find all of the major organic search operators below, broken up into three categories: “Basic”, “Advanced”, and “Unreliable”. Basic search operators are operators that modify standard text searches.\\n   I. Basic search operators     \" \"   \"nikola tesla\"  Put any phrase in quotes to force Google to use exact-match. On single words, prevents synonyms.   OR   tesla OR edison  Google search defaults to logical AND between terms. Specify \"OR\" for a logical OR (ALL-CAPS).   |   tesla | edison  The pipe (|) operator is identical to \"OR\". Useful if your Caps-lock is broken :)   ( )   (tesla OR edison) alternating current  Use parentheses to group operators and control the order in which they execute.   -   tesla -motors  Put minus (-) in front of any term (including operators) to exclude that term from the results.   *   tesla \"rock * roll\"  An asterisk (*) acts as a wild-card and will match on any word.   #..#   tesla announcement 2015..2017  Use (..) with numbers on either side to match on any integer in that range of numbers.   $   tesla deposit $1000  Search prices with the dollar sign ($). You can combine ($) and (.) for exact prices, like $19.99.   €   €9,99 lunch deals  Search prices with the Euro sign (€). Most other currency signs don\\'t seem to be honored by Google.    in   250 kph in mph  Use \"in\" to convert between two equivalent units. This returns a special, Knowledge Card style result.   \\nAdvanced search operators are special commands that modify searches and may require additional parameters (such as a domain name). Advanced operators are typically used to narrow searches and drill deeper into results.\\n   II. Advanced search operators     intitle:   intitle:\"tesla vs edison\"  Search only in the page\\'s title for a word or phrase. Use exact-match (quotes) for phrases.   allintitle:   allintitle: tesla vs edison  Search the page title for every individual term following \"allintitle:\". Same as multiple intitle:\\'s.   inurl:   tesla announcements inurl:2016  Look for a word or phrase (in quotes) in the document URL. Can combine with other terms.   allinurl:   allinurl: amazon field-keywords nikon  Search the URL for every individual term following \"allinurl:\". Same as multiple inurl:\\'s.   intext:   intext:\"orbi vs eero vs google wifi\"  Search for a word or phrase (in quotes), but only in the body/document text.   allintext:   allintext: orbi eero google wifi  Search the body text for every individual term following \"allintext:\". Same as multiple intexts:\\'s.   filetype:   \"tesla announcements\" filetype:pdf  Match only a specific file type. Some examples include PDF, DOC, XLS, PPT, and TXT.   related:   related:nytimes.com  Return sites that are related to a target domain. Only works for larger domains.   AROUND(X)   tesla AROUND(3) edison  Returns results where the two terms/phrases are within (X) words of each other.   \\nUnreliable operators have either been found to produce inconsistent results or have been deprecated altogether. The \"link:\" operator was officially deprecated in early 2017. It appears that \"inanchor:\" operators are still in use, but return very narrow and sometimes unreliable results. Use link-based operators only for initial research.\\n   III. Unreliable/deprecated operators     ~   ~cars  Include synonyms. Seems to be unreliable, and synonym inclusion is default now.   +   +cars  Force exact-match on a single phrase. Deprecated with the launch of Google+.   daterange:   tesla announcements daterange:2457663-2457754  Return results in the specified range. Can be inconsistent. Requires Julian dates.   link:   link:nytimes.com  Find pages that link to the target domain. This operator was deprecated in early 2017.   inanchor:   inanchor:\"tesla announcements\"  Find pages linked to with the specified anchor text/phrase. Data is heavily sampled.   allinanchor:   allinanchor: tesla announcements  Find pages with all individual terms after \"inanchor:\" in the inbound anchor text.   \\nNote that, for all of the \"allin...:\" operators, Google will try to apply the operator to every term following it. Combining \"allin...:\" operators with any other operators will almost never produce the desired results.\\nSearch operator tips &amp; tricks\\nHaving all of the pieces is only the first step in building a puzzle. The real power of search operators comes from combining them.\\n1. Chain together operator combos\\nYou can chain together almost any combination of text searches, basic operators, and advanced operators:\\n\"nikola tesla\" intitle:\"top 5..10 facts\" -site:youtube.com inurl:2015\\nThis search returns any pages that mention \"Nikola Tesla\" (exact-match), have the phrase \"Top (X) facts\" in the title, where X ranges from 5 to 10, are not on YouTube.com, and have \"2015\" somewhere in the URL.\\n2. Hunt down plagiarized content\\nTrying to find out if your content is unique or if someone is plagiarizing you? Use a unique phrase from your text, put it in quotes (exact-match) after an \"intext:\" operator, and exclude your own site with \"-site:\"...\\nintext:\"they were frolicking in our entrails\" -site:moz.com\\nSimilarly, you can use \"intitle:\" with a long, exact-match phrase to find duplicate copies of your content.\\n3. Audit your HTTP-&gt;HTTPS transition\\nSwitching a site from HTTP to HTTPS can be challenging. Double-check your progress by seeing how many of each type of page Google has indexed. Use the \"site:\" operator on your root domain and then exclude HTTPS pages with \"-inurl:\"...\\nsite:moz.com -inurl:https\\nThis will help you track down any stragglers or find pages that might not have been re-crawled by Google.\\nThese are just a few examples of a nearly infinite set of combinations. Looking for more examples? You\\'re in luck! We\\'ve created a mega-list of 67 examples to catapult you toward site operator mastery.\\nRise in the rankings with Moz Pro\\nWith top-notch link and keyword data and in-depth analytics, Moz Pro provides the tracking and insights you need to reach #1. Take a free 30-day trial on us and see what you can achieve:\\n Start my free trial \\nDeep dive into Google search parameters\\nEver wanted to know how to construct your own Google search strings? This ultimate guide contains all of Google\\'s search string parameters. you can also build your own advanced search using google\\'s advanced search form.\\nhttp://www.google.com/search?\\nGoogle\\'s URL. You\\'ll see it if you look at the address bar, or Chrome omnibar.\\nq=query+goes+here\\nThe query string. Words are separated by + signs.\\nEverything from here on in is preceded by an &amp; sign, as it\\'s tagged on to the end. Here\\'s where things get interesting...\\n 1. Exact match query \\nas_epq=query+goes+here\\nResults must include the query, in the word order displayed.\\n Shows as \"query goes here\" \\n    2. Advanced \"Or\" filter  \\nas_oq=\"query+string\"+goes+here\\nResults must include one or more of the words in this string. \\nBasically, it\\'s like a more advanced version of the one above, using an \"or\" filter. Thus, every result must have the main initial query, and one or more of the sets of terms in these strings.\\n Shows as \"query string\" OR goes OR here     3. Negative Keywords  \\nas_eq=don\\'t+include+these+words\\nResults must NOT include any words in this string.\\n Shows as -don\\'t -include -these -words \\n 4. Limit the number of results  \\nnum=xx\\nControls the number of results shown. \\nMust be a numeric value, and can be anything up to 100. Doesn\\'t work with fractions.\\n 5. Filetype match \\nas_filetype=extension\\nOnly returns results that end in .extension. Currently supports any input. Try it - make a file with a random extension, get it indexed and do a search. Also shows that as long as it validates to something.\\n Shows as filetype:extension \\n 6. Limit results to one site  \\nas_sitesearch=example.com\\nLimits results to just the site you choose.\\n Shows as site:example.com \\n 7. Find results from specific dates   \\nas_qdr=x\\nSwap out x for the following to limit the search to only files first indexed in:\\n d - the previous 24 hours w - the previous seven days m - the previous month y - past year mn - the previous n number of months. So m2 would be the previous two, m3 would be three, and so on. Does work into double digits \\n 8. Find pages with specific usage rights \\nas_rights=xxx\\nLimits the search to files/pages that have certain rights. The options are:\\n (cc_publicdomain|cc_attribute|cc_sharealike|cc_noncommercial|cc_nonderived) - free to use or share (cc_publicdomain|cc_attribute|cc_sharealike|cc_nonderived).-(cc_noncommercial) - free to use or share, including commercially (cc_publicdomain|cc_attribute|cc_sharealike|cc_noncommercial).-(cc_nonderived) - free to use, share, or modify (cc_publicdomain|cc_attribute|cc_sharealike).-(cc_noncommercial|cc_nonderived) - free to use, share, or modify commercially \\nIf you want to make up your own, put the bits you want in brackets, separated by pipe characters (|), and exclude the bits you don\\'t by putting them in brackets, preceded by .- and again pipe-separated.\\n 9. Do an allintitle search as a query string \\nallintitle%3Asearch+terms\\nThis is actually appended to the q= parameter, hence a search for fishing with the allintitle term \"sea bass\" would require the following query:\\nq=fishing+allintitle%3Asea+bass\\n Shows as allintitle:search terms \\nN.B. This also works with allintext to search page body text, allinurl for searching the URL, and allinanchor for finding sites that are linked to with certain anchor text.   \\n 10. Find products in a specific price range \\nnnn..yyyy\\nLike the allin parameters, this is actually appended to the q= parameter. What this does though is let you search for results between numeric ranges. For example, if you wanted to find documents with numbers between 15 and 100, you\\'d put in 15..100. Very useful for finding products in a price range, when combined with the site limiter. Works with $, £, and other such things.\\n Shows as query 15..100 \\n 11. Do + searches as a query string  \\n%2Bterm\\nAgain, this is appended to the q= parameter. The %2B is actually the + sign encoded, and will return results featuring only the term used, with no pluralisations, alternate tenses, or synonyms.\\n Shows as +term \\n        12. Find results for your search term, and synonyms    \\n~term\\nAnother one that\\'s appended to the q= parameter. Returns results for the term used and synonyms.\\n Shows as ~term \\n      13. Find definitions for your search term    \\ndefine%3Aword\\nYet another q= parameter add-on. Returns definitions for the word you put in.\\n Shows as define:word \\n 14. Find results for two words that can have other words in between  \\nterm * term two\\nAnd another q= parameter add-on. Returns results with listings that contain both words, with other words between them.\\n 15. Use Google\\'s calculator via query string \\nn+n2, n-n2, n/n2, n*n2, n^n2 and n% of n2\\nGoogle\\'s calculator functions. They are, in order, add, subtract, divide, multiply, raise to the power of, and return x percentage of.\\n 16. Modify safe search \\nsafe=active\\nSets safe search to on. To turn it off, change active to images.\\n 17. Find similar sites \\nas_rq=example.com\\nFinds sites Google thinks are related to the URL you put in.\\n Shows as query related:example.com \\n   18. View a site\\'s backlinks  \\nas_lq=example.com\\nFinds sites that link to the URL you put in.\\n Shows as query link:example.com \\n 19. Open a new window  \\nnewwindow=n\\nOpens clicked listings in a new window. Very useful for opening lots of documents at a time, for competitor research. Set to 1 to activate, and 0 to turn it off.\\n 20  . Modify personalized search  \\npws\\nControls whether personalised search is on or not. Set to 1 to activate, and 0 to turn it off.\\n 21 . Stop Adwords from collecting data \\nadtest=on\\nTurns off AdWords database connection, so your browsing won\\'t show up as an impression, and will disable the URLs. Set to on to activate, and off to turn it off.\\n 22 . Simulate a button click \\nbtnG=Search\\nSimulates a click on the normal Google results buttom. Change to btnI to get the I\\'m Feeling Lucky button result.\\n 23 . Change input encoding settings \\nie=\\nControls the input encoding settings. This defaults to UTF-8, and is worked out server-side, hence changing it doesn\\'t do anything.\\n 24 . Change output encoding settings \\noe=\\nControls the output encoding settings. Works in the same way as ie, so you can tinker away, but it won\\'t do anything.\\n 25 . Change language \\n&amp;hl=value\\nChanges the interface language. I won\\'t list them all here, but you can find them all here. \\n 26 . Limit languages \\nlr=value\\nLimits the languages used to return results. Not hugely effective. That said, here\\'s the list of all of them:\\n lang_ar - Arabic lang_hy - Armenian lang_be - Belarusian lang_bg - Bulgarian lang_ca - Catalan lang_hr - Croatian lang_cs - Czech lang_da - Danish lang_nl - Dutch lang_en - English lang_eo - Esperanto lang_et - Estonian lang_tl - Filipino lang_fi - Finnish lang_fr - French lang_de - German lang_el - Greek lang_iw - Hebrew lang_hu - Hungarian lang_is - Icelandic lang_id - Indonesian lang_it - Italian lang_ja - Japanese lang_ko - Korean lang_lv - Latvian lang_lt - Lithuanian lang_no - Norwegian lang_fa - Persian lang_pl - Polish lang_pt - Portuguese lang_ro - Romanian lang_ru - Russian lang_sr - Serbian lang_sk - Slovak lang_sl - Slovenian lang_es - Spanish lang_sv - Swedish lang_th - Thai lang_tr - Turkish lang_uk - Ukrainian lang_vi - Vietnamese lang_zh-CN - Chinese Simplified lang_zh-TW - Chinese Traditional \\n 27 . Only view pages from certain locations \\ncr=countryXX\\nLimits the search results to pages/sites from certain locations. Change XX to any of the following, to limit the results:\\n AF - Afghanistan AL - Albania DZ - Algeria AS - American Samoa AD - Andorra AO - Angola AI - Anguilla AQ - Antarctica AG - Antigua and Barbuda AR - Argentina AM - Armenia AW - Aruba AU - Australia AT - Austria AZ - Azerbaijan BS - Bahamas BH - Bahrain BD - Bangladesh BB - Barbados BY - Belarus BE - Belgium BZ - Belize BJ - Benin BM - Bermuda BT - Bhutan BO - Bolivia BA - Bosnia and Herzegovina BW - Botswana BV - Bouvet Island BR - Brazil IO - British Indian Ocean Territory VG - British Virgin Islands BN - Brunei BG - Bulgaria BF - Burkina Faso BI - Burundi KH - Cambodia CM - Cameroon CA - Canada CV - Cape Verde KY - Cayman Islands CF - Central African Republic TD - Chad CL - Chile CN - China CX - Christmas Island CC - Cocos (Keeling) Islands CO - Colombia KM - Comoros CG - Congo - Brazzaville CD - Congo - Kinshasa CK - Cook Islands CR - Costa Rica CI - Cote d\\'Ivoire HR - Croatia CU - Cuba CY - Cyprus CZ - Czech Republic DK - Denmark DJ - Djibouti DM - Dominica DO - Dominican Republic EC - Ecuador EG - Egypt SV - El Salvador GQ - Equatorial Guinea ER - Eritrea EE - Estonia SZ - Eswatini ET - Ethiopia FK - Falkland Islands (Malvinas) FO - Faroe Islands FJ - Fiji FI - Finland FR - France GF - French Guiana PF - French Polynesia TF - French Southern Territories GA - Gabon GM - Gambia GE - Georgia DE - Germany GH - Ghana GI - Gibraltar GR - Greece GL - Greenland GD - Grenada GP - Guadeloupe GU - Guam GT - Guatemala GN - Guinea GW - Guinea-Bissau GY - Guyana HT - Haiti HM - Heard and McDonald Islands VA - Holy Sea HN - Honduras HK - Hong Kong HU - Hungary IS - Iceland IN - India ID - Indonesia IQ - Iraq IE - Ireland IL - Israel IT - Italy JM - Jamaica JP - Japan JO - Jordan KZ - Kazakhstan KE - Kenya KI - Kiribati KP - Korea, Democratic People\\'s Republic of KR - Korea, Republic of KW - Kuwait KG - Kyrgyzstan LA - Lao People\\'s Democratic Republic LV - Latvia LB - Lebanon LS - Lesotho LR - Liberia LY - Libyan Arab Jamahiriya LI - Liechtenstein LT - Lithuania LU - Luxembourg MO - Macau MK - Macedonia MG - Madagascar MW - Malawi MY - Malaysia MV - Maldives ML - Mali MT - Malta MH - Marshall Islands MQ - Martinique MR - Mauritania MU - Mauritius YT - Mayotte MX - Mexico FM - Micronesia, Federated States of MD - Moldova, Republic of MC - Monaco MN - Mongolia MS - Montserrat MA - Morocco MZ - Mozambique MM - Myanmar NA - Namibia NR - Nauru NP - Nepal NL - Netherlands AN - Netherlands Antilles NC - New Caledonia NZ - New Zealand NI - Nicaragua NE - Niger NG - Nigeria NU - Niue NF - Norfolk Island MP - Northern Mariana Islands NO - Norway OM - Oman PK - Pakistan PW - Palau PS - Palestinian Territory PA - Panama PG - Papua New Guinea PY - Paraguay PE - Peru PH - Philippines PN - Pitcairn PL - Poland PT - Portugal PR - Puerto Rico QA - Qatar RE - Reunion RO - Romania RU - Russian Federation RW - Rwanda SH - Saint Helena KN - Saint Kitts and Nevis LC - Saint Lucia PM - Saint Pierre &amp; Miquelon VC - Saint Vincent and the Grenadines WS - Samoa SM - San Marino ST - Sao Tome and Principe SA - Saudi Arabia SN - Senegal CS - Serbia and Montenegro SC - Seychelles SL - Sierra Leone SG - Singapore SK - Slovakia SI - Slovenia SB - Solomon Islands SO - Somalia ZA - South Africa GS - South Georgia and The South Sandwich Islands ES - Spain LK - Sri Lanka SD - Sudan SR - Suriname SJ - Svalbard &amp; Jan Mayen SE - Sweden CH - Switzerland SY - Syrian Arab Republic TW - Taiwan TJ - Tajikistan TZ - Tanzania TH - Thailand TL - Timor-Leste TG - Togo TK - Tokelau TO - Tonga TT - Trinidad and Tobago TN - Tunisia TR - Turkey TM - Turkmenistan TC - Turks and Caicos Islands TV - Tuvalu UG - Uganda UA - Ukraine AE - United Arab Emirates GB - United Kingdom US - United States UM - United States Minor Outlying Islands UY - Uruguay UZ - Uzbekistan VU - Vanuatu VE - Venezuela VN - Viet Nam VG - Virgin Islands (British) VI - Virgin Islands (U.S.) WF - Wallis and Futuna Islands EH - Western Sahara YE - Yemen ZM - Zambia ZW - Zimbabwe \\nKeep learning\\n  Mastering Google Search Operators in 67 Easy Steps   SEO Essentials Certification   Beginner\\'s Guide to SEO: How Search Engines Work: Crawling, Indexing, and Ranking   \\n \\nPut your skills to work\\nGauge a Site\\'s Influence with Link Explorer\\nLink Explorer is a link popularity and backlink analysis tool that lets you research and compare any site on the web.',\n",

That makes sense, considering that Google dominates the search engine market with over 90% usage. And that’s why most SEOs focus their efforts on optimizing for Google.\\nBut Google isn’t the only player. There are plenty of alternative search engines that are constantly innovating. One notable example is Bing, which has been steadily increasing its market share. So now is the perfect time to broaden your horizons and explore what other top search engines have to offer.\\nSo, if you're curious about what else is out there, you're in the right place. I’ve rounded up the best search engines and analyzed their performance so you can easily find Google alternatives for a more comprehensive search experience.\\nHere’s the top search engines list:\\n Google \\n Bing \\n Yahoo Search \\n YouTube \\n DuckDuckGo \\n AOL Search \\n Ecosia \\n Qwant \\n Ask.com \\n Dogpile \\n Yandex \\n Startpage \\n Swisscows \\n Brave Search \\n iAsk AI \\nCriteria for evaluating search engines\\nI analyzed the following factors when creating this search engine list:\\nRelevance of search results\\nRelevance of search results is quite a subjective thing. However, a good search engine should have some settings and filters so that a user can tune the search and get the most relevant results possible.\\nFor example, many search engines offer features that tailor results to certain languages, locations, and preferences. Plus, they can also remember your past searches to provide on-point results over time.\\nUser interface and experience\\nA search engine's interface should be clean, intuitive, and easy to navigate, making it simple for users to find what they need without any hassle.\\nAnother important factor is how the search results are displayed. For instance, Google now offers continuous scrolling, so you can keep seeing more results without clicking through pages. On the other hand, some search engines still use paginated results, which some people might prefer for a more segmented view. The choice depends on what works best for you.\\nPrivacy features\\nWith increasing concerns about online security, more and more private search engines appear. They offer robust privacy features like encrypted search capabilities, strict data storage policies, and options for anonymous searching when user data is not tracked or stored.\\nIntegration with other services\\nThe ability of search engines to connect and search through other services can enhance productivity. For instance, Google can search through your Google Drive to find documents when you type their names into the search bar. Other integrations might include syncing with email, calendars, and even social media platforms.\\nTop 15 search engines in 2024\\nFinding the right search engine really depends on your personal needs and preferences. To help you navigate your options, I've put together a comparison table that breaks down the key features of the top 15 search engines. This should make it much easier for you to decide which one best suits you.\\n \\n Note: If you are an SEO and don’t know what search engine you should optimize for, analyze your audience and understand where your audience hangs out.\\n \\nGoogle\\n \\n Google is the undisputed leader in the top search engines list. And I’m almost sure that most of you found this article in Google’s SERP :)\\nGoogle is the most widely used search engine globally. It is known for its powerful algorithms, vast index of web pages, and AI capabilities. And it constantly tweaks its search algorithms to deliver relevant results.\\n \\nKey features:\\n  Featured snippets : These highlighted boxes at the top of the search results provide a quick answer to your query, often from a high-ranking website.\\n Image and video carousels: This feature displays relevant images and videos in a horizontal carousel, making it easier to find visual content related to your query.\\n AI Overviews: By using advanced AI technology, Google analyzes your search query and provides a quick, informative summary directly within the search results page.\\n Local results: For searches with local intent, Google shows a map and a list of nearby businesses or services.\\n Google Lens: It’s a visual search feature. By simply snapping a picture of an object or uploading an existing image, you can find similar pictures or products for shopping.\\n Instant answers: Google provides immediate answers to certain types of queries, like calculations, weather, sports scores, and currency conversions, directly at the top of the search results page.\\n Integrations with Google services: You can easily access and manage your Gmail, Google Drive, Google Calendar, and Google Photos directly from the search results. For example, if you type the name of a document saved in your Google Drive, it can appear right in the search results, saving you the hassle of navigating to Drive manually.\\n   Search operators \\nBing\\n \\n Bing,\",\n",
       "    'Search engines are online tools that allow users to search for content on the internet.  Google is the most popular. But many other search sites and apps get millions of visits each month. Explore our list of the best search engines in the world (grouped by type, in no particular order). Or jump straight to our search engine FAQs. Mainstream Search Engines 1. Google    Google is generally considered the world’s best search engine. It’s had over 88% market share since Statcounter began collecting data, in January 2009. Not only was it the world’s most popular search engine in June 2023, but it was the world’s most visited website, with over 106.5 billion visits. Google uses a vast number of algorithms (called “ranking systems”) to provide users with fast and accurate search results. It also offers other popular services—like Google Maps, YouTube, and Gmail. Google\\'s search engine results pages (SERPs) are typically populated with various SERP features (like featured snippets, People Also Ask sections, and knowledge panels), based on the type of the search query. In February 2023, Google introduced its AI-powered search assistant called Bard.   Google has faced many criticisms over the years. The most common are related to the amount of data it collects about its users. That\\'s why privacy concerns are a common reason users seek Google alternatives. 2. Bing   Created by Microsoft in 2009, Bing is the second-largest search engine in the world. But that equated to just 2.77% market share in June 2023. Bing\\'s strength lies in its multimedia search capabilities—namely advanced image and video search results.  Another interesting feature is its rewards program. Every Bing search earns you points that can go toward gift cards and charitable donations. In 2023, Bing became the first mainstream search engine to introduce an AI-powered search assistant in its search results.

Privacy Search Engines The market for privacy-oriented search engines is growing as more people become concerned about their online privacy. As a result, many existing search engines are adding privacy-focused features to their platforms.  3. DuckDuckGo    DuckDuckGo is the most popular search engine that prioritizes user privacy. It doesn’t track, collect, or store any of your data. It still uses non-personalized ads, though. The search results come from a variety of sources, including its own crawler and other search engines (but not Google).  DuckDuckGo offers features such as advanced commands, which allow you to speed up your search.  For example, if you type \"!a family tents\" into DuckDuckGo\\'s search bar, you\\'ll land directly on Amazon’s results page with family tents. Also, DuckDuckGo’s search interface is easy to customize to your preferences.  4. Startpage    Startpage is a search engine that focuses on user privacy and security. This includes no recording of personal data and search history, no profiling of users, and removal of IP addresses from Startpage\\'s servers.  It sources its search results from Google. Which makes it a popular alternative for those who value privacy but still want the accuracy of Google\\'s search results. The company also offers a secured email platform called StartMail. 5. Qwant    Qwant is a search engine that doesn’t track its users. Making it one of the best search engines for people concerned about their privacy. Like other free search engines, Qwant funds itself through ads. But, because there are no cookies, Qwant’s advertisers cannot target ads to specific users. Although it’s an English-language site, Qwant is developed and hosted in France. 6. Brave Search    Brave Search is a privacy-focused search engine that offers a private and anonymous search.  You can use it within or outside of the Brave web browser.  Unlike some other smaller search engines, Brave uses its own web index and algorithms. But you can enable “Google fallback.” This means Brave will also check Google to provide more accurate results. Its Summarizer feature (highlighted above) is an AI-powered tool that provides direct answers in search results. 7. You.com    You.com is a relatively new search engine. It was founded in 2021 and uses Microsoft\\'s Bing results as a source of data.  Similarly to other newer search engines, You.com focuses on privacy and personalization of the search results.  You can pick from over 150 apps to add to the search engine rankings. For example, you can add sections with dedicated Amazon results, YouTube videos, TripAdvisor listings, etc.  You.com also offers a set of AI-powered apps, including the chat assistant YouChat, a writing assistant called YouWrite, and an AI image generator called YouImagine. 8. Swisscows    Swisscows is a privacy-oriented search engine founded in 2014. It has its own web crawler and index, but it also uses Bing as a data source. A unique feature of this search site is its family friendliness: It does not index or show pornographic or sexual results. In addition to the search engine, Swisscows provides services like an email client, a virtual private network (VPN), and a privacy-focused messenger.  You can set up Swisscows as your default search engine in Chrome by installing its plugin.  International Search Engines Search engines like Google cater to various regions and languages. But they don’t always provide the localized results people want. Let’s look at some of the best search engines in non-English-speaking countries, such as China, South Korea, and Czechia. 9. Yandex    Yandex is the largest search engine in Russia, with 58.22% local market share as of June 2023. It is also used in other countries, including Belarus, Turkey, and Kazakhstan.  Besides the Russian version, Yandex also has a global English version at yandex.com.

To help you identify issues that could harm your SEO.  Which Search Engines Use AI?

       "    'When you talk search engines with marketers, Google often is the first name you hear. It’s the heavyweight of online search, with more than an   81% share of the search market  . \\n Google isn’t the only player on the field. A variety of alternative search engines are growing in popularity and attracting users from different industries. \\n In this post, we’ll look at 11 top search engines worldwide, so you know where to focus your optimization efforts in 2024. \\n Best search engines \\n  Google \\nBing\\n  Yahoo! \\n  Yandex \\n  Baidu \\n  DuckDuckGo \\n  Ask \\n  Narver \\n  AOL \\n  Internet Archive \\n  Ecosia \\n1.   Google \\n   \\n No surprises here: as of January 2024, Google holds first place in search, with more than 81% of the market share. Its popularity comes from delivering fast and accurate search results. \\n Google’s algorithms are key players here. They sift through tons of search data to find what users are looking for. This system is what makes Google searches so reliable and quick. \\n Its search engine results pages (SERPs) often include features like knowledge panels, People Also Ask sections, and feature snippets. Keep this in mind when optimizing your website for Google’s search platform.       Note: It’s worth mentioning that Google is the default search engine for most web browsers. This includes widely used browsers like Chrome and Safari, among others. \\n2.   Bing \\n   \\n Bing is the second largest search engine in the world, with more than 10% search market share. \\n This web search engine is owned and operated by Microsoft and has its origins in the previous search engines MSN Search and Windows Live Search. \\n Like Google, the search engine also filters search results into different tabs, such as images, videos, maps, and news. Additionally, it has a dedicated rewards program that gives users redeemable points when they shop or search using Bing. \\n3.   Yahoo! \\n   \\n Third on our list of top search engines is Yahoo!, with a market share of just over 2%. \\n Yahoo! was once a heavily used search engine with a distinct identity. Today, it’s more of a web portal featuring different types of content, including trending news stories, weather forecasts, and more. \\n Plus, Yahoo! is now powered by Bing, so the results from both search engines are very similar. \\n4.   Yandex \\n   \\n Yandex has nearly 2% of the global search market share. While it’s not that renowned in the US, Yandex is the most popular search engine in Russia. \\n Yandex uses various algorithms and metrics to figure out how useful a website is. One of these is site quality index, or SQI. This index looks at things like how big a site’s audience is, how happy users are with it, how much they trust it, and more. \\n Moreover, Yandex assesses if a searcher is looking for local information, and adjusts its results accordingly. To make sure your site appears in these region-specific searches, you need to set your website’s location in Yandex’s webmaster tools. \\n5.   Baidu \\n   \\n Baidu launched in 2000 and is now the top search engine in China. It’s been growing fast, and in recent years, it’s surpassed other search engines in market share. \\n The look of Baidu is quite like Google’s, but written in Mandarin. It has a white background, blue links, and green URLs. \\n Just like Google, Baidu wants to provide the best quality search results to its users. If you’re looking to reach the Asian market, think about using Baidu. \\n6.   DuckDuckGo \\n   \\n DuckDuckGo is a privacy focused search engine that’s gaining traction among users concerned about privacy. \\n DuckDuckGo pulls its search results from a mix of its own crawler, other search engines, and various sources. However, it doesn’t use Google’s data, meaning you’ll need to diversify your SEO strategies beyond just Google’s algorithms to rank on its platform. \\n Moreover, DuckDuckGo offers unique features like “bangs”, which are shortcuts that direct users to search directly on other sites. For instance, typing “!w” followed by a search term will lead directly to Wikipedia’s search results. Understanding and possibly integrating such features could enhance user experience for those coming from DuckDuckGo. \\n7.   Ask \\n   \\n Founded in 1996 by Garrett Gruener and David Warthen in California, Ask originally was named Ask Jeeves. \\n The idea was not to create another directory or search engine, but a question-and-answer service, much like a virtual concierge. This is why the founders chose to name the site after P.G. Wodehouse’s character Jeeves the butler. \\n The company dropped “Jeeves” from its name in 2006, when it rebranded as simply Ask. \\n In 2010, Ask gave up on the search engine market after facing stiff competition from more successful search engines. Now, Google powers Ask search results. \\n8.   Naver \\n   \\n Naver holds the title of South Korea’s second most popular search site, with a 34% share in the market. \\n It’s a specialized search engine that focuses on local Korean content. With Naver, users can catch up on news and get search suggestions, among other things. \\n If you’re looking to target the South Korean market, make sure your search engine optimization strategies align with Naver’s focus. \\n9.   AOL \\n   \\n AOL is a search engine that Yahoo! owns, with Bing powering its search results. \\n AOL is similar to Yahoo! because it’s also part of the Bing search network. This setup lets advertisers promote their campaigns on all three search engines—AOL, Yahoo!, and Bing. \\n They can even advertise on related sites, like MSN.com. \\n10.   Internet Archive \\n   \\n The Internet Archive is a unique search engine that focuses on preserving and sharing content rather than ranking it. \\n You can find a wide range of materials here, including books, movies, music, and even snapshots of entire websites. \\n A key feature of the Internet Archive is the WayBackMachine. This tool allows you to travel back as far as 1996 to see how websites appeared at a specific time. It’s perfect for exploring a site’s search history and understanding its development over the years. \\n11.   Ecosia \\n   \\n It might not be one of the most popular search engines in the world, but we feel Ecosia deserves a special mention. \\n Ecosia is based in Berlin, Germany, and uses the money from advertising to plant trees around the world to benefit people, the environment, and local economies. This means that just by using the search engine, you can contribute to the environment. \\n Plus, the search engine provides an individual counter that tells you how many trees your searches have planted. \\n Optimizing your site for top search engines \\n Ultimately, optimization requires matching your efforts with the right search engine. \\n Whether targeting a global audience with Google or focusing on privacy-conscious users with DuckDuckGo, understanding each engine’s focus is key to effective SEO. \\n Embrace the diversity of these platforms and you’ll have a successful foundation for generating organic traffic for your site. \\n Top search engines FAQ \\n What is the number one search engine right now? \\n Google is the number one search engine by far, with a nearly 82% hold on the search market. That’s why SEO experts are always trying to crack Google’s ranking secrets. Plus, Google’s great for searching news, images, videos, and even academic journals. \\n What is the oldest search engine engine around? \\n The first-ever search engine was created in 1990 and was named Archie. If we’re talking about the oldest search engines still going, there’s WebCrawler, Yahoo!, and Lycos—all born in 1994. \\n What are the three most used search engines? \\n The big three search engines are Google, Bing, and Yahoo! These are the names you’ll hear most when people talk about searching online. \\n What search engines use AI? \\n Many search engines today power their search results with AI. For example: \\n Bing uses Bing AI to power its search results. \\n Brave Search runs on Brave AI. \\n Google uses Bard AI. \\n Which search engines have their own crawlers \\n Here’s a list of search engines that have their own web index and crawl the internet: \\n Google \\n Bing \\n Yahoo! \\n Baidu \\n DuckDuckGo \\n Most other search engines lean on Google or Bing for their results. \\n  Want to Learn More?  \\n  23 Amazing Google Chrome Extensions That You Need to Use in 2019  \\n  11 Everyday Hobbies That Make Money – and How to Get Started Today  \\n  The 200 Best Inspirational Business Quotes for Entrepreneurs  \\n How to Create a YouTube Channel',\n",
       "    \"TL;DR Search Engines allows people to discover content across the web through their software system based on keywords and phrases given by the searchers and the sites' relevance. What is a search engine? A web search engine or Internet search engine is a software system designed to carry out web search (Internet search) based on a query (keyword or phrase) and display the most relevant websites as a result. How do search engines work and how many of them are there? Search engines get the information from spider (crawlers) by crawling websites from a link to another one, and by checking the sitemaps and robots.txt files.  Once the crawlers gather information about the information, they send back the data to be indexed based on the titles, meta description, and other meta-tags, content, alt-attributes, site structure, headings, CSS, and Javascript. All sites are ranked based on their relevance for the searchers and the index report. The world's most frequently used search engines are:  Google Bing Yandex DuckDuckGo Yahoo!

       "   'search_results': ['From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\\n \\nAn industry analyst performs primary and secondary market research within an industry such as information technology, consulting or insurance. Analysts assess sector trends, create segment taxonomies, size markets, prepare forecasts, and develop industry models. Industry analysts usually work for research and advisory services firms, and some analysts also perform advisory (consulting) services. Typically, analysts specialize in a single segment or sub-segment, researching the broad development of the market rather than focusing on specific publicly traded companies, equities, investments, or associated financial opportunities as a financial analyst might.\\n Coverage  [  edit  ]  \\nThe IIAR provides this official definition: [1] \\n  An information and communications technology (ICT) industry analyst is a person, working individually or within a firm, whose business model incorporates creating and publishing research about, and advising on how, why and where ICT-related products and services can be procured, deployed and used.\\n That is not to say that industry analysts do not focus on specific market participants and their product and service portfolios, or that financial analysts ignore industries. Gideon Gartner, one of the industry analyst business pioneers, was a former financial analyst before launching the Gartner Group in 1979. [2]  But industry analysts do research in the context of a specific sector or market segment, along with the competitive offerings of the other public and non-public companies that comprise the market.\\n In many industries there is significant overlap between the work product of industry analysts and financial analysts. The information technology and consulting industries, however, are examples of industries where a significant proportion of important market participants are not publicly traded entities with readily available information and highly regulated disclosure requirements.\\n Most analyst firms focus on one or more market segments, such as cloud computing, wireless communications, audit services, or pharmaceutical industry safety monitoring. Analyst firms and the analysts that work for them are continuously expanding and shifting their coverage areas to keep pace with trends like technological convergence or media convergence, for example. This is because demand for industry analyst research services is closely associated with the frequency of change in an industry. So the largest analyst firms tend to have extremely dynamic offerings, and the concentration of service offerings of all market players tends to focus on industry areas that are currently undergoing change.\\n History  [  edit  ]  \\nThere are three industry analyst firms that have been in continuous operation since 1970 or earlier. Computer Review is the oldest analyst firm that has been in continuous operation since its inception in 1959, as Adams Associates. International Data Corp has been providing industry analyst and publishing services since 1964, and continues to be operated as a private company by its founder, Patrick Joseph McGovern. The last of the three, the Yankee Group, was founded by Howard Anderson in 1970. [3]  Anderson ran the firm until 1999.\\n Many industry analyst firms and analysts trace their roots to one of these three firms, particularly IDC, Gartner and the Yankee Group. [1] George Colony, for example, was an analyst at the Yankee Group before founding Forrester Research. Dale Kutnick was also a Yankee Group analyst and equity holder before joining Gartner and later founding the Meta Group, which was subsequently purchased by Gartner. Yankee Group was ultimately acquired by 451 Research in 2013.[2] Jim Lundy and Mike Anderson were analysts at Gartner before they founded Aragon Research.\\n Industry analyst business  [  edit  ]  \\nA community of more than 740 analyst firms spans the world. [4]  Research and advisory staffs at these companies range from one person to more than 1,000.\\n Well-known analyst firms using \"traditional\" business models include 451 Research, Gartner, IBISWorld, International Data Corporation, Informa Telecoms &amp; Media, SNL Kagan, Ovum Ltd, Yankee Group, Digital Clarity Group and Aragon Research.\\n The \"traditional\" business model, based on continuous information services (CIS, aka subscriptions) where analysts author reports that are then sold to many clients is under pressure. [5]  Several firms are designing new analyst business models  [6]  based on contemporary technologies, open-source licensing concepts, emerging markets, loosely federated analysts, and/or a more radical and visible emphasis on offshoring. Notable examples of analyst firms developing models based on social media such as Canada\\'s ConneKted Minds and \"open research and analysis\" include RedMonk, [7] \\nMWD Advisors, Quocirca, ResearchFarm, Freeform Dynamics, Omnisperience and Cambashi, all based in or having offices in the United Kingdom, and US-based Wikibon, an open-source project. Singapore-based Springboard Research (now owned by Forrester) exemplifies progressive use of offshoring research and Experton and Experture exemplify loose federations of independent analysts. capioIT exemplifies firms which focus on emerging geographic and technology markets.\\n Roles and deliverables  [  edit  ]  \\nIndustry analysts provide a combination of syndicated and client-sponsored (bespoke) market research, competitive intelligence, and management consulting services.\\n Deliverables take many forms that can be grouped as follows:\\n publications like research reports, white papers, research notes, and newsletters\\nadvisory services that include inquiries, briefings, consulting projects, study findings presentations or bespoke speaking engagements (for instance at internal client meetings or industry events)\\nevents such as conferences, seminars, roundtables\\nmarket analysis, such as quantitative market trends, forecasts and market shares. \\nAnalyst firms serve a management decision support function at corporations and public service organisations and for the vendors, regulators and investors serving those industries. [8]   [9] \\n Industry analysts serving buyers of technology-based products and services, where the largest concentration of industry analysts provide services, work with three primary groups of clients:\\n Commercial and public service entities that use technology-based products and services.\\nVendors providing products and services to commercial and public service organizations, and the channel intermediaries that resell or aggregate these products and services, including hardware manufacturers, communications companies, software firms, IT services providers, value-added resellers, mobile network operators, and content aggregators.\\nOrganizations that invest-in, regulate, or support the vendors and intermediaries, including investment banks, anti-trust regulators, chambers of commerce, and leasing companies. \\nThe subjects of research conducted by analysts include many of the same stakeholders that also buy services from analysts. This has caused the integrity of the research to be questioned, which is covered in more detail below. These research subjects include product and service buyers, users, and implementers; the product and service providers themselves, including their key supply chain partners; and sources of investment capital for the vendors, capital for client purchases of vendor products and services, and regulators. Analysts also perform at least passive sales support for their firms, such as contributing to sales meetings, contracts, project profitability, or lead generation programs. This is necessary because the clients are paying for their expertise and must have an opportunity to assess associated capabilities.\\n At most firms, analysts set research agendas in close cooperation with clients, design surveys, analyse findings, and write research. They may also conduct the surveys themselves, or they may work with third parties or interns to perform the data collection. Increasingly, analyst firms and their subcontractors employ online survey tools and offshoring to reduce research costs and turnaround time. In some cases, analyst firms are mining new sources of information from research partners, like consumer cell phone bills, RFID-enabled point of sale data, and analytics on Web traffic.\\n Typically, technology and service providers work to influence the analyst research agenda and coverage of their firm, and to build trusted relationships with individual analysts. This is done through a specialized marketing function called industry analyst relations or analyst relations, where some analyst relations staff members specialize themselves in certain product, service, industry, or geographic areas of the vendor organization. This function not only facilitates effective two-way communications between the analyst firm and the vendor, it attempts to concentrate and control spending on industry analyst research and advisory services.\\n It has become a common practice for analyst firms to assign a central \"vendor relations\" contact within their organization, to coordinate briefing, reprint and similar requests from vendors. Commercial and public sector client organizations have now assigned sourcing and procurement category managers as the primary contact for research and advisory services firms as well, to concentrate and better leverage spending on related products and services.\\n Skills  [  edit  ]  \\nCompanies participating in the industry analyst profession have not adopted universal standards for employee education, skills, or professional conduct. Some firms adhere to standards set by competitive intelligence, market research or other professional associations. Overall, this situation results in competitive differentiation among analyst firms.\\n Most analyst firms require above-average written and oral communication skills.\\n Integrity and transparency issues  [  edit  ]  \\nAnalyst objectivity and accuracy is an issue that is frequently debated. [10]   [11]  Much of the criticism appears to focus on the business relationships between analysts and the technology providers that are the subjects of their research. In short, analyst firms often rely heavily on revenues from the technology providers they cover (e.g., Darwin magazine, March 2001).\\n This source of revenue is a significant component of the business models of most analyst firms. Individual analysts and teams conduct research on industry segments where a vendor may provide products or services, and that same individual or group may provide research deliverables or advisory services to a vendor serving that segment. The analyst is then expected to provide independent objective advice to buyers of those products and services. This matrix of relationships presents opportunities where conflicts can arise. This is exacerbated by the training many vendor analyst relations professionals receive, where they are advised to focus spending on analysts that have the most ability to influence purchases of goods and services by clients, and to bypass controls analyst firms may have in place to preserve that objectivity by limiting direct access to certain analysts for non-research purposes.\\n There is also the issue of analyst firms signing boilerplate confidentiality agreements with vendor firms. This occurs when licensing research or performing advisory work, or when conducting detailed briefings in advance of announcements. The language in those agreements often limits the disclosure of certain information that may be disclosed to analysts in the normal course of their research, limiting their ability to fully disclose research findings to buyers of any research deliverable. Some research organizations now refuse to sign confidentiality agreements with vendors or service providers. But there may be a legacy of agreements in place that perpetually limit disclosure for some large vendor clients, so some of the smaller firms have limited work with vendors.\\n Burton Research, for example, enforces a cap of 20% of revenues to be derived from product vendors or service providers. Burton is now owned by Gartner, and continues to limit its vendor expenditures. Real Story Group is a small boutique firm that performs research on products and publishes evaluations. It works solely for buyers and refuses to accept business from vendors that are subjects of its evaluations. Despite a few exceptions, buy side industry analysts represent a small minority of analyst firms today. Even research firms whose services are tailored specifically to the interests of product and service buyers often derive some proportion of their revenues from vendors and service providers, since that information is important to them as well.\\n Another side to this debate is that analyst firms create hype and influence markets in several ways [12]  or at even influence deals directly when speaking to end-user buyers.\\n The debate over objectivity and independence has always been an active one, with some firms using independence (in absolute and relative terms) as a source of strategic differentiation. Other factors that affect research integrity include transparency with regard to research methodology and survey sampling, theoretical or shallow vs. in-depth or hands-on expertise of analysts, [13]  emphasis on qualitative over quantitative research, and the overall efficacy of a firm\\'s research offerings toward the goal of improving the quality of business and technology decisions.

A pervasive game is one in which the game experience extends into the actual world or where the fictive world of the game merges with the physical world. How pervasive games can adapt to the ever-changing nature of technology and design in current society requires a comprehensive review.Objective: In this systematic review, we aimed to measure and analyze 4 dimensions of pervasive games through development, technology, experience, and evaluation. Moreover, we also aimed to discover and interpret their relationship with game, interaction, experience, and service design.Methods:We first chose 3 well-known databases, Web of Science, Scopus, and EBSCO, and searched from 2013 to April 2022. A strictly thorough Boolean search for research keywords such as \"pervasive game,\" \"design,\" and \"interactive\" resulted in 394 relevant articles. These articles were identified, screened, and checked for eligibility to find valid and useful articles, which were then categorized and analyzed using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) method.Results:The systematic selection was finally left with 40 valid and valuable articles. After categorization and analysis, all articles were classified according to 4 main themes, which were design and development (11/40, 28%), interaction and technology (15/40, 38%), users and experience (9/40, 23%), and evaluation and service (5/40, 13%). These 4 main areas can be subdivided into several smaller areas.Conclusions:In the 4 areas of game design, interaction design, experience design, and service design, many scholars have studied pervasive games and made contributions. Although the development and technology of pervasive games have evolved with the times, there is still a need to strengthen emerging design concepts within pervasive games.\\nIntroduction Background\\nDuring the global COVID-19 pandemic, people from all walks of life played video games to find joy, connection, and a sense of belonging. A game is a source of entertainment and comfort for millions of people in all countries, and it transcends age, race, gender, platform, and political party. In 2021, according to the Entertainment Software Association survey, 90% of gamers agreed that video games bring joy and strongly agreed that they can inspire (79%), provide mental stimulation (87%), and relieve stress (87%) [1]. Sensor Tower released its Mobile Gaming 2022 report, which provides insight into how challenges affect different regions and game genres and which markets continue to grow in the face of these challenges. The biggest game opportunity is in China, as can be interpreted from the data. China currently leads the mobile game industry in terms of revenue and downloads and is expected to maintain its dominant position in the coming years [2]. Multiplayer online battle arena has proven to be one of the most challenging but rewarding game genres in the mobile game market, bringing a series of huge successes and painful failures. The latest high-profile multiplayer online battle arena to be released on cell phones is Pokémon Unite, developed by Pokémon Company in partnership with Tencent\\'s TiMi Studio. Pokémon GO was downloaded more than 15 million times in the first 2 days of its release, making it the biggest release ever. By the end of the first week, the game had reached approximately 30 million downloads in 7 days [3].\\nPervasive games are a very important subfield among the many game classifications. As early as 2009, Montola et al [4] wrote in their book that pervasive games were defined as having one or more salient features that expand the contractual magic circle of play spatially, temporally, or socially. Initially, pervasive games were relatively simple to play. Game players with other players and nonplayer characters communicate via phone, email, or MSN Messenger [4]. However, now, pervasive games are a whole new game style that extends game experiences into the actual world, weaving into the fabric of players\\' real-life settings [5]. According to some researchers, a pervasive game is when the player\\'s experience is extended to the actual world, achievable because of the device\\'s sensors [6]. These games are a relatively new type of entertainment that takes the game experience out of the device and into the actual environment, merging virtual and physical realities [7].\\nPervasive games use mobile devices\\' data collection, geotagging, e-commerce, internet cookies, and social media capabilities [8]. Pervasive games rose to popularity with the release of Niantic\\'s Pokémon GO in 2016. Two games now dominate the pervasive games market: Pokémon GO and Ingress [9]. Ingress has a rather simple core loop and low polish, but its dynamics seem to be tailored to enforce team socializing and collaboration [10]. After the successor to Ingress, Pokémon GO offers a more complicated primary gameplay loop. The mechanics of Pokémon GO\\'s main gameplay loop are more intertwined than those of Ingress; nonetheless, the game focuses significantly more on the individual\\'s experiences in the Pokémon world and far less on social connections and collaboration [11].\\nObjectives\\nOn the basis of the abovementioned background retrospect, it can be seen that further research on pervasive games is necessary. As design continues to evolve, many new concepts are being added. There is a need to add more current design factors in the game design industry. For example, interaction design, experience design, service design, and branding design are popular design concepts that constantly influence game design. In addition, the existing systematic review articles fail to provide detailed information on the review process. This includes keyword identification, article screening, and article eligibility. Moreover, because of this situation, prospective researchers could not reconstruct the survey, authorize interpretation, or assess the breadth of the data. Furthermore, this study is important because it provides researchers with an understanding of peer literature reviews and helps researchers better understand pervasive game design issues that may require academic attention. The current systematic analysis was conducted to answer the primary research question: Does the pervasive game embody other conceptions of thinking in the design field? The survey\\'s primary focus was on perceptions of pervasive game design, including perceptions of design thinking in interaction design, experience design, service design, and branding design.\\nThe Methods section describes the procedure used to answer the research topic of this study. The Results section conducts a systematic review and synthesis of the scientific literature to identify, select, and analyze the research needed on pervasive game design within design thinking situations. Finally, the Discussion section discusses the steps that must be followed, emphasizing the importance of aspiring academics understanding the issues.\\nMethods\\nOverview\\nSeveral studies related to system evaluation have been conducted globally. However, only a few studies have focused on the design thinking connotations of pervasive games in the context of design thinking [4][5][6][7][8]. This section describes the need for a systematic analysis of the design thinking connotations of pervasive games. In contrast, the following section presents the methodology used to find the research answers formulated by this study. This literature analysis is divided into four sections:\\n(1) design and development, (2) interaction and technology, (3) user and experience, and (4) evaluation and service. Furthermore, this section systematically reviews and synthesizes the scientific literature to distinguish, screen, and analyze important pervasive game research. Finally, reflecting on potential scholars suggests what actions should be taken to address the issues raised. The prerecording systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA [Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses]) approach was used in this analysis, a documented standard for conducting a systematic literature review. In general, publication rules are required to aid writers in assessing and reviewing the quality\\nIdentification\\nThe systematic review process can be divided into 3 main phases, each of which is responsible for selecting several appropriate papers for this report. The first step is the identification of keywords, followed by a search for related and analogous terms using resources such as the thesaurus, dictionaries, encyclopedias, and earlier research. Consequently, after determining all pertinent keywords, search strings for the databases Scopus, Web of Science, and EBSCO (Textbox 1) were formulated. This review successfully retrieved 394 papers from 3 databases during the first step of conducting a systematic review.\\nScreening\\nDuring the preliminary screening, duplicate papers were eliminated from consideration. In the first phase, we decided not to include 29 articles. In the second phase, we used several inclusion and exclusion criteria developed to screen 73 a',\n",

A common goal is to induce social interactions that draw players without head-mounted displays into a shared game world. Exploring these asymmetries resulted in many artifacts, creating an innovative yet disparate research landscape that showcases points for improvement in coverage of the field and theoretical underpinnings. In this article, we present a literature review of asymmetry in multiplayer VR games, using a framework synthesis method to assess the field through a lens of existing literature on asymmetries in gameplay. We provide an overview of this emerging subfield and identify gaps and opportunities for future research. Moreover, we discuss how research artifacts address prior theoretical work and present a \"best fit\" framework of asymmetric multiplayer VR games for the community to build upon.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nVirtual reality (VR) technology has received immense interest from researchers, developers, designers, and the games industry alike in recent years. Proponents praise VR\\'s ability to facilitate novel and immersive experiences. Nevertheless, the immersive quality of VR technologies, in particular head-mounted displays (HMDs), has also received criticism for its potentially isolating characteristics, both technologically and socially . This isolation risk has inspired game designs that enhance the VR experience by including bystanders as co-players. These game designs can leverage the benefits of multiplayer game experiences (e.g., supporting social connectedness; Woods, 2009;Vella et al., 2019) without requiring additional HMDs. Examples include giving bystanders insight into the virtual environments (VEs) inhabited by the HMD player (e.g., via a monitor displaying their camera perspective; Jeong et al., 2020), or an active role in the game (e.g., giving them essential information that the HMD player requires, thus enforcing communication; Liszio and Masuch, 2016;Smilovitch and Lachman, 2019).\\nThese interactions of HMD players with non-HMD players can be considered a type of asymmetry: a difference in the interface with which users interact with the VE. However, while asymmetry of player interfaces is increasingly common in VR experiences (rooted in cross-reality paradigms), there are many other asymmetry types that can be designed (Harris et al., 2016). Asymmetric games explicitly incorporate and design for differences between players in how they interact with the game, and for the abilities and information the players possess within the game world. With the influx of research in this context, asymmetric multiplayer games are emerging as a subfield of VR games research.\\nThe VR artifacts 1 being produced-and related findings on how asymmetric game designs affect player experience (PX)-are novel and innovative because this is an emerging research field. Nevertheless, the artifacts are also disparate in their focus. In particular, few designers or researchers deeply engage with prior theories on designing for and catering to gameplay asymmetries in general (outside of VR). We argue that a systematic approach and close integration of theory-driven games research is essential to leverage the full potential of asymmetric multiplayer VR games. As a first step, we aim to gain an overview of how asymmetries are being incorporated in multiplayer VR games, investigating what asymmetries multiplayer VR games contain and how multiplayer VR asymmetries affect player experience.\\nTo map out this research area, we conducted a literature review on asymmetric multiplayer VR games. Beginning with 481 identified records from The ACM Guide to Computing Literature and Scopus covering the majority of the humancomputer interaction (HCI) literature, we followed a systematic screening and snowballing approach (via PRISMA; Moher et al., 2009) to arrive at a corpus of 25 relevant papers on asymmetric multiplayer VR games.\\nGiven the novelty of asymmetric multiplayer VR, we employed a method based on framework synthesis (Carroll et al., 2011;Dixon-Woods, 2011) to guide our analysis of these papers against the backdrop of prior literature. Papers were synthesized within a \"best fit\" framework based on theoretical work on asymmetry in games, gameplay aesthetics, social aspects of PX, and shared control. This methodology works well for research fields in which there is no clear \"best fit\" theory: it applies multiple theories or models to reduce limitations of a single one. This allows researchers to \"engage with theory but not be constrained by it\" (Carroll et al., 2013). Further, as it is open to improvements on the a priori framework, it turns the review into an opportunity to reflect on and refine existing theory.\\nThe goal of the review was to explore the following questions: 1) what kinds of asymmetry are being explored in research on multiplayer VR games, and 2) how asymmetry in these games affects PX. For this purpose, we sought out papers that touched on the design and/or evaluation (for any participant group, with any intervention, comparison, or outcome) of any kind of asymmetric gameplay within a multiplayer game experience featuring at least one HMD-VR player.\\nThe contributions of this work are twofold: 1) Our work provides an overview of this emerging subfield of VR games research, shows how it engages with prior theoretical research on asymmetry, and identifies gaps in the literature to guide future research. Specifically, we point to the following as opportunities for future work: multiplayer games with more than two players, alternative interfaces to monitor variants, mirrored and unidirectional interdependence between players, remote play, shared control within the game world are rare in the design of asymmetric multiplayer VR games. Additionally, effects of player skill or familiarity with interface and partner are rarely considered. Explicitly shared physical spaces, embodied physical interaction, and the presence of a human co-player emerged as the key drivers of positive PX in asymmetric multiplayer VR. These key findings are summarized in Table 3. 2) Furthermore, we present, apply, and refine the \"best fit\" framework for the asymmetric VR games field to employ and build upon (see Figures 2, 3). While time will bear out the use of the refined framework, we suggest that it has generative, structural, and analytical potential: it could inform the design of asymmetric multiplayer VR games to systematically explore the overall design space (generative), scaffold reporting and description of such games (structural), and guide both future evaluations and literature reviews of such games (analytical).\\nBACKGROUND\\nProgress in VR has long been entangled with \"other\" forms of realities resulting in mixed realities (MR; Milgram and Kishino, 1994), which enrich the real world with virtual content as in augmented reality (AR) or augmented virtuality (AV), which \"mutually reflect, influence, and merge into each other\" (Lifton, 2007). Such mutual interactions between realities is often described as cross-reality (XR; Want, 2009) or blended reality (Schmidt et al., 2019), and increasingly refers to any exchange of information between realities \"to [. . .] a meaningful and discernable effect\" (Coleman, 2009). A close and bidirectional connection between VR and the real world is necessary for collaboration in scenarios that see one user located in VR and one in the real world (Coleman, 2009;Reilly et al., 2010). The general increase in VR usage in recent years is also driving a trend toward XR designs and research (Efstratios et al., 2018;George et al., 2019;Nakagawa and Sonobe, 2019;Kiourt et al., 2020;Simeone et al., 2020;Wang et al., 2020). In particular, the social aspects of cross-reality VR research are becoming popular (Yassien et al., 2020). For example, VR researchers are exploring the questions of understanding how different environments (e.g., public, private) and familiarity among users can affect XR experiences , how they can provide VR users with an awareness of the presence of those around them , and whether bystanders can understand the experiences of VR users by observing them (George et al., 2019).\\nVR is increasingly available to consumers. However, the usage of multiple HMDs at the same time remains rare because of the cost, required space, and potential collisions between users. VR\\'s most appealing feature-its immersiveness-can also engender isolation Mütterlein and Hess, 2017;Rogers et al., 2019). Thus, cross-reality consisting of the inclusion of non-VR users into the VR experience (asymmetry of interface) has been explored as a way to increase social interaction for both the HMD user and bystanders (e.g., Gugenheimer et al., 2017a;Zhou et al., 2019;Lee et al., 2020), with promising results for enjoyment and social connection. Furthermore, it may offer an alternative to users suff',\n",
       "    'The advent of utility computing has revolutionized almost every sector of traditional software development. Especially commercial cloud computing services, pioneered by the likes of Amazon, Google and Microsoft, have provided an unprecedented opportunity for the fast and sustainable development of complex distributed systems. Nevertheless, existing models and tools aim primarily for systems where resource usage—by humans and bots alike—is logically and physically quite disperse resulting in a low likelihood of conflicting resource access. However, a number of resource-intensive applications, such as Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) and large-scale simulations introduce a requirement for a very large common state with many actors accessing it simultaneously and thus a high likelihood of conflicting resource access. This paper presents a systematic mapping study of the state-of-the-art in software technology aiming explicitly to support the development of MMOGs, a class of large-scale, resource-intensive software systems. By examining the main focus of a diverse set of related publications, we identify a list of criteria that are important for MMOG development. Then, we categorize the selected studies based on the inferred criteria in order to compare their approach, unveil the challenges faced in each of them and reveal research trends that might be present. Finally we attempt to identify research directions which appear promising for enabling the use of standardized technology for this class of systems.',\n",

Athlos: A Framework for Developing Scalable MMOG Backends on\\nCommodity clouds. Software\\n20221Published: 7 March 202210.3390/software1010006Received: 26 January 2022 Accepted: 3 March 2022107-145. https://doi.org/10.3390/ software1010006 Academic Editor: Claus Pahl\\nIntroduction\\nThe unprecedented availability of computing power provided by cloud computing technology has led to a drive towards its adoption by organizations and individuals alike [1]. Especially for businesses, the cost-effectiveness of this technology distinguishes it among other options and has made cloud computing a popular option for hosting enterprise applications, especially at the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) layer [2]. The ever-increasing drive to migrate services to the cloud stems not only from its relative cost-effectiveness, but also from the ability to innovate and optimize business processes, especially those related to mobile and web technologies [3]. Most enterprise applications must be scalable to accommodate increasing numbers of customers while maintaining a good quality of experience and economies of scale. The services provided by such applications are often optimized for throughput and parallel execution, which makes them easy to scale due to a limited need for synchronization when accessing resources [4]. For the most part, the logic behind the services provided by such applications can be easily migrated to either a private or public cloud.\\nOn the other hand, resource-demanding applications such as backends of Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) are traditionally characterized by the need to rapidly synchronize and update their state. This requirement imposes several constraints which have inhibited their migration to the cloud. To cope with such high resource demands, developers and researchers have employed several technologies and approaches. Firstly, MMOGs are traditionally configured to run in sessions or rooms, utilizing zones to divide gameplay requirements among peers in a network [5,6]. These techniques limit the number of concurrent players to cope with the high resource demand. Despite increases in computing power in recent years, even Multiplayer Online Battle Arenas (MOBAs) [7] cannot support more than several hundred simultaneous players. In addition, hugely successful MMOGs with persistent worlds such as World of Warcraft have faced problems in managing such a high influx of players and had to break them down into more manageable units, with \"each server [hosting] a community of about 20,000 players\" [8]. Moreover, MMOG backends are categorized as soft real-time applications and must deliver a satisfactory Quality of Experience (QoE) in a market of ever-increasing competition. To achieve this, they must be able to handle these resource-demanding tasks quickly and thus offer low-latency gameplay [9]. While achieving such high performance relies on having access to raw computing power, MMOGs must also employ a \"cost-efficient design\" [10]. This highlights the need to have high-performance, cost-efficient, and adaptive development methods and tools that can enable MMOG backends to achieve a high level of QoE. Alternatively, recent studies have began exploring the potential of utilizing IoT (Internet of Things) technology to support and extend the main infrastructure. By using smaller but still capable devices, it is possible to \"offload [the] processing [of] demanding [. . . ] tasks to the edges of the cloud and in close proximity to the end users\" [11], thus reducing the network distance and latency, and ultimately increasing the QoE.\\nNaturally, the vast majority of the research and development for MMOGs in the cloud focuses on the Infrastructure-as-a-Service layer (IaaS), which is inherently more suitable in this scenario due to finer control and less overhead when compared to other layers, such as Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) or Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). Game developers have traditionally hosted their MMOG backends on dedicated servers and private clouds, rather than public clouds. Nonetheless, recent trends show that there is a slow shift toward higher abstraction layers such as PaaS, and perhaps the use of commodity clouds [12]. One of the probable causes for this shift might be the inherent elasticity of these higher layers. Even though there have been several resources citing the use of higher layers such as Platform-as-a-Service and Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) for MMOG backends [13,14], the hosting and development approaches used are not standardized in any way. Consequently, there has been very limited effort to develop and evaluate models and methods to facilitate the development of this type of software on such infrastructure.\\nIn this paper we investigate how MMOG backends-which are resource-intensive and latency-sensitive applications-can be developed for and deployed on commodity cloud platforms. Our study is primarily focused on proposing solutions to the problems of scalability and state consistency. We specifically target games with persistent, scalable states that have a high number of concurrent players, but which do not require very low latency. We predict that the use of public clouds, in conjunction with higher abstraction layers such as PaaS and FaaS (Function-as-a-Service) will enable MMOG backends to become more elastic, economic, and may allow developers to utilize common models, methods, and tools to rapidly develop MMOG prototypes.\\nWe present Athlos, a framework for developing scalable MMOG backends that can run on and leverage the resources of commodity cloud infrastructure. Within this framework, we propose a model that aims to abstract the development process by decoupling the game logic and state management from other game development processes such as networking, storage, and data management. Our model utilizes several concepts in business applications, but also provides solutions that allow MMOGs to attain scalable states and runtimes at low latency. In addition, we propose the use of several standardized methods to develop and host MMOG backends. This aims to facilitate the rapid development and deployment of game prototypes using a selection of approaches, both on and off the cloud and at varying layers of abstraction. Our framework also provides tools with which it is possible to create and manage abstract game definitions that do not follow a specific approach and are not linked to a runtime environment. These definitions allow developers to experiment with different approaches and perform analyses before expanding their prototypes to fully implemented MMOGs. By using Athlos, we aim to reinforce the notion that higher computing layers such as PaaS, FaaS, and BaaS are suitable approaches for the development of MMOG backends. Despite our focus on scalable, persistent states, our approach can be generalized to support non-persistent, low-latency, moderately scalable game states as well.\\nTo evaluate our framework, we develop three MMOG prototypes that leverage technologies based on the PaaS, FaaS, and BaaS layers. We guide our evaluation based on three core requirements: (a) provide a feasible method to develop MMOG backends, (b) deliver satisfactory performance, and (c) reduce development effort and improve the quality of the produced code. To assess the ability of our approach to meet these requirements, we explore the following research questions:\\n1.\\nMMOGs that are hosted on cloud PaaS and utilize the Athlos framework inherit the underlying scalability to achieve a better (lower) ratio of latency to the number of active players compared to custom approaches that use single-machine dedicated architectures and do not utilize Athlos.\\n2.\\nMMOGs based on Athlos and hosted on cloud PaaS sustain a higher total number of active players than single-machine, non-Athlos approaches, under the threshold latency of 1000 ms.\\n3.\\nMMOGs that utilize our framework are able to feature very large (within the limits of the hardware resources being utilized) and expandable game states. 4.\\nWhen using Athlos, the time taken to retrieve a sub-state of a game world remains constant regardless of the world\\'s size. 5.\\nThe development of scalable MMOG backends using Athlos simplifies the development process and results to lower effort and time taken to develop an MMOG backend. 6.\\nThe Athlos approach produces high-quality, readable, and re-usable code.\\nTo explore these questions, we deploy the game backend prototypes on a popular public cloud platform and conduct a series of simulations to evaluate their performance under different loads and scales. Then, we conduct an empirical analysis of the prototypes\\' code to assess its quality, as well as the effort undertaken to develop such games using Athlos. Our results indicate that games based on our approach can take advantage of the framework\\'s methodology to achieve much larger scales compared to dedicated approaches that are used by online game developers, both in terms of runtime and pure state size. In terms of scalability and quality of experience, we show that MMOG backends based on Athlos have the potential to serve a much larger number of concurrent players under a given latency threshold, especially when hosted on the PaaS layer; rather than other layers of cloud computing or using dedicated hosting. Through our code evaluation, we show that Athlos allows developers to create MMOG backends using significantly less effort than other approaches we used, even though the quality of the code could be improved.\\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 explores the related work, followed by Section 3 which describes our motivations behind this study. In Section 4, we outline our methodology for the development of scalable MMOG backends on commodity clouds. In Section 5 we demonstrate the use of ou',\n",

Virtual Games, Real\\n Interactions: A Look at Cross-reality Asymmetrical Co-located Social Games.\\n In Extended Abstracts of the CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing\\n Systems (CHI EA ’24), May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA. ACM, New York,\\n NY, USA, 9 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3613905.3650824\\n 1 INTRODUCTION\\n Asymmetrical cross-reality interfaces involve multiple users shar-\\ning a synchronous experience (e.g., gaming, collaborative work,\\n   Page 2 of 9 CHI EA ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA Kitson, et al.\\n meeting) in the same virtual environment using different modal-\\nities [12, 24, 49]. Users can be co-located or physically separated\\n [55], and may each be using a different device, each positioned on\\n a different point in the reality-virtuality continuum [41], to engage\\n in some form of interaction with other users, agents, and objects.\\n The limited, albeit rapidly growing, body of literature [4] notes that\\n the asymmetry introduces flexibility and user agency in how expe-\\nriences are shared [26]. It also provides an inclusive environment\\n wherein even bystanders can be involved in the shared experience\\n [25]. Asymmetrical interfaces reflect the evolution of user experi-\\nences in extended realities (XR) that have traditionally focused on\\n single-user applications to multi-user, multi-device environments\\n that allow users to engage in synchronous, social interactions with\\n the agency to select the device that they feel most comfortable\\n using or best meets their interaction goal.\\n Extant literature has largely investigated this work both for-\\nmally and informally in a controlled laboratory setting, limiting the\\n generalizability of applying prior findings to the design and imple-\\nmentation of asymmetrical interface products. The current study\\n is a preliminary foray into observing the implementation of two\\n asymmetrical interface games in a naturalistic social setting. The\\n current mixed-methods case study sheds insights into the ecologi-\\ncal validity of asymmetrical interface deployment in an everyday\\n setting where variances in available devices, problems of space and\\n place, and user motivations and expertise are introduced. We hope\\n that the research questions and preliminary findings introduced in\\n this \"prequel\" serve as the impetus to critical conversations on how\\n asymmetrical interfaces can be effectively deployed in the field and\\n preemptively consider how the technical, spatial, and social barri-\\ners may be overcome. Therefore, we pose the following research\\n questions:\\n RQ1: What do player experiences look like for asymmetrical\\n cross-reality VR games in a real-world social setting with multiple\\n co-located players?\\n RQ2: What are key design elements in asymmetrical cross-reality\\n VR games that (a) promote enjoyable play experiences for all players,\\n and (b) hinder enjoyment during gameplay?\\n 2 RELATED WORK: ASYMMETRY IN VR\\n EXPERIENCES\\n With the rapid advancement in immersive technologies, the imple-\\nmentation of virtual worlds is expanding into a continuum [51],\\n evolving from the clear boundaries of VR and AR that scholars have\\n worked within for many years. The multitude of devices on the\\n spectrum being used to access these virtual worlds creates inherent\\n asymmetries. Asymmetry, characterized by discrepancies in capabil-\\nities or interfaces among players [27], can manifest in several ways\\n in multi-player experiences. Ouverson and Gilbert [43] define five\\n dimensions of asymmetry: spatial co-presence, transportation, in-\\nformational richness, team interdependence, and balance of power.\\n Such asymmetry can be leveraged for strategic and biometric inter-\\ndependence, greatly enhancing engagement even when some play-\\ners lack access to head-mounted displays (HMDs) [24, 33, 35, 49].\\n While asymmetry is an inherent part of several VR games (see Fig-\\nure 2 for examples), it has been largely understudied in research\\n (e.g., only 25 such papers were identified in [49], a review of ex-\\ntant literature until 2021). Research that does study the effects of\\n asymmetry tends to be conducted in controlled lab environments.\\n Broadly, we are interested in exploring how asymmetrical VR play\\n experiences could be leveraged to improve group social dynamics\\n in a real-world setting. Here, we introduce some background on\\n hybrid multi-device asymmetrical systems, a specific understud-\\nied aspect of asymmetry (user scale), and how previous work has\\n leveraged asymmetry to include spectators.\\n 2.1 Hybrid Multi-device Asymmetrical Systems\\n With an increasing number of devices in an average user’s tech\\n ecosystem, researchers are exploring ways of bridging interactions\\n between devices (e.g., [45]). At the same time, users are learning\\n to interact and collaborate synchronously across different forms of\\n extended realities and interfaces (e.g., VR and AR; VR and desktop).\\n This hybrid form of multi-device collaboration is anticipated to\\n gain popularity as everyday consumers attempt to integrate immer-\\nsive technologies into their life and work routines. Academically,\\n concurrent users playing synchronously, with each user entering\\n the same VR space with different devices, introduces questions of\\n asymmetrical or cross-reality interfaces (c.f. [3, 49]). Researchers\\n have explored such device asymmetries between a VR player and\\n desktop [35], tablets [9], and robots [8]. These questions are in-\\nteresting because each user brings with them a different set of\\n media affordances [18], [2], wherein users strategically leverage\\n the unique features of media platforms that allow a certain range\\n of actions.\\n For example, HMD users with hand controllers will be able to use\\n each of their hands freely to pick up and grab objects whereas tablet\\n users may not have the same capability. On the other hand, tablet\\n users may easily be able to get a birds-eye perspective of the world\\n map whereas HMD users can only look around the world through\\n their stereoscopic lenses [9]. Earlier work has found that the ac-\\ntion possibilities, combined with the way users decide to leverage\\n these features, can largely determine user experience outcomes\\n [30], requiring more intensive communication and coordination\\n when users are on different devices [35]. The emerging body of\\n literature seems to generally point to positive user responses from\\n this hybrid, multi-device form of gameplay [35, 49]; however, socio-\\ntechnical hurdles introduced as users attempt to coordinate across\\n the varied media affordances of asymmetrical interfaces are bound\\n to cause friction, particularly in naturalistic settings without tight\\n experimenter control.\\n 2.2 Asymmetry of Scale and Embodiment\\n Illusion\\n Scale is a particularly interesting element in the Player Experience\\n in asymmetrical device systems which has been particularly under-\\nstudied. Virtual worlds are often populated by users manifesting as\\n avatars [22, 23, 46, 47]. A differentiating factor for avatar embodi-\\nment in VR as compared to non-immersive media is the first-person\\n perspective [36], which makes studying scale-related asymmetry\\n particularly interesting when one of the players is using immer-\\nsive VR. Some of the documented effects of embodiment include\\n enhanced sensory experiences such as haptics [20]; cognition can\\n   Page 3 of 9 Asymmetrical Co-located XR Gameplay CHI EA ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA\\n also be enhanced when using an avatar [44, 54]; the self-avatar\\n follower effect [21], by which the avatar movements can influence\\n the participants; or the Proteus effect [61]\\n This type of plasticity allows easy modifications to the body\\n schema and body ownership, first demonstrated by the rubber hand\\n illusion [10]. This effect was then reproduced in large mannequins\\n [16, 39] and it has since been found quite easy to substitute a real\\n body with a virtual one [50, 53]. The plasticity of the illusion is very\\n large—as such, embodiment works even if the avatar has altered\\n sizes of body parts (e.g., creating large belly illusion [42], long\\n arms [37], Pinocchio illusions [6], Barbies or giant dolls [59]). Giant\\n avatars have an additional impact on aspects such as locomotion\\n [15], simplifying a traditionally complex problem of having to move\\n around a very large virtual environment while constrained in a\\n small physical space [1]. While other ways to speed in large spaces\\n might produce motion sickness, as shown in [1], being a giant allows\\n users to reach much further while maintaining 1 to 1 motions.\\n It is not surprising, then, that several multiplayer games use giant\\n avatars for VR players (see Figure 2). The giants in these games are\\n often stationary or have minimal mobility requirements, reducing\\n issues stemming from locomotion. The immersion through a VR\\n HMD enables a powerful embodiment illusion that increases the\\n presence plausibility of the experience [52]. At the same time, the\\n players using the other device modality typically control a smaller-\\nscale avatar with high mobility. This is true for both the games we\\n studied in this paper: DAVIGO 1\\n (desktop users control avatars who\\n can move quickly and attack the VR giant) and Acron 2\\n (mobile\\n phone users control small squirrels to steal acorns from a giant oak\\n tree embodied by the VR user).\\n We chose these games due to access, and since both of these\\n games manifest asymmetry along most of the dimensions defined\\n in [43] (spatial co-presence: in Acron, the squirrels share a playing\\n field while the giant tree is alone; transportation: the VR player\\n in both games had minimal mobility whereas non-VR had more\\n movement agency; informational richness: information exposed to\\n players was dependent on their roles; team interdependence: both\\n games had an adversarial VR vs. non-VR mechanic, with each group\\n bringing their own goals; and balance of power: the VR giant had\\n abilities like picking up and throwing the non-VR users, while\\n non-VR players could use powerups in both games).\\n 2.3 Including Spectators in VR Experiences\\n Large screens have often engaged otherwise passive spectators\\n in-game experiences (e.g., [31, 48]). When one of the participants\\n in the experience is in VR, it allows us to further blend the reality\\n between player and spectator, particularly when they are co-located\\n in the same physical space. One approach involves instrumenting\\n rooms with projectors and depth cameras, to expand the basic\\n capabilities of rooms, creating experiences like IllumiRoom [34],\\n or RoomAlive [60]. This allows for greater spectator experiences\\n as well as more awareness of the player’s immediate space. This\\n same technology can blend the VR world for the user. For example,\\n in remixing reality, the physical space can be used to improve the\\n 1DAVIGO on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1116540/DAVIGO_VR_vs_\\n PC/\\n 2Acron on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1094870/Acron_Attack_of_\\n the_Squirrels/\\n experience of the VR player [29, 40], and to reproject the view\\n of the VR headset to the spectators who don’t have HMDs (e.g.,\\n MeetAlive [19]). In RealityCheck [29] users can also transition in\\n and out VR seamlessly thanks to the physical augmentation of the\\n virtual worlds. Blending the physical space into an HMD-wearer’s\\n reality comes naturally with Mixed Reality (MR) headsets. This\\n was used in Astaire [62]—a collocated two-person play experience\\n where one person is ‘in headset’ with one controller, and the other\\n person wears the other controller and they do a “partner dance”,\\n making spectators an active part of the experience.\\n 3 METHODS AND MATERIALS\\n We conducted an informal user evaluation and compared the VR\\n user to the PC/Phone users and Spectators, as well as compared the\\n use of a projector (PC) to no projector (Phone). We used DAVIGO\\n and Acron on two different days. Both games are similar in that\\n the PC/Phone players join efforts to attack the VR Player, who is a\\n giant (Figure 2). We use the term “co-located” because all players\\n observed in the study playing the same game were physically in the\\n same room. During gameplay, there were interactions and verbal\\n communications with the other co-located players that may or may\\n not be related to the game. While both games make use of VR\\n headsets, we use the term “XR” as a general term that incorporates\\n the spectrum of experiences across the reality-virtuality continuum.\\n In both games, VR is one endpoint, while the other is either a PC or\\n phone. In our case, the PC was not isolated because of spectators\\n and the gameplay was broadcast over a projector. Also, there was\\n substantial interaction between phone users in terms of strategizing.\\n Therefore, both games argue for the usage of the term XR as well\\n as the value of discussing co-location.\\n 3.1 Study Design\\n We employed a mixed-methods case study approach to investigate\\n situated and asymmetrical modalities in the context of XR gaming\\n for enabling social interactions. Our embedded design involved ob-\\nservations and a post-experience questionnaire using standardized\\n metrics (see below). Qualitative data were thematically analyzed\\n and quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive tests. Inte-\\ngration of findings was achieved through triangulation to allow\\n for a comprehensive interpretation of the ecological validity of\\n asymmetrical interface deployment in an everyday setting.\\n 3.2 Metrics\\n We collected data on participants’ self-reported user experience, em-\\nbodiment [17], enjoyment (adopted from [7, 11, 38]), task difficulty\\n [28], social presence [14], and mediated social communication[58]\\n using a questionnaire based on existing, validated metrics. We used\\n existing questionnaires to inform our survey since validated ques-\\ntionnaires that capture all of our constructs of interest without\\n putting significant time demands on participants do not yet exist.\\n Readers should note that we did not score our survey as the original\\n assessments; therefore, comparisons should be made cautiously. We\\n compared different modalities of XR gaming interactions in asym-\\nmetrical settings. Additionally, we considered participant demo-\\ngraphics such as age, gender, prior gaming experience, and gamer\\n type (based on [5]) to explore potential individual differences. User\\n   Page 4 of 9 CHI EA ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA Kitson, et al.\\n Figure 2: A selection of games that use giant avatars, including Acron and DAVIGO (highlighted), which we chose to use for our\\n study.\\n experience was captured through several aspects of user preference\\n and engagement with the XR experience. We evaluated gaming pref-\\nerences using open-ended questions about which role they liked the\\n best, what they thought was key in making this gaming experience\\n inviting, and if they liked having the projector. User engagement\\n was operationalized through observable behaviours such as time\\n played, collaborative interactions and voluntary participation. Par-\\nticipants rated their XR gaming experience using a 5pt-Likert scale\\n from “I do not agree at all” to “I fully agree.” For a breakdown of all\\n questions, please see Appendix A. The quantitative measures were\\n intended to be descriptive for this case study; inferential statistical\\n tests were not conducted due to the small sample size.\\n 3.3 Apparatus\\n DAVIGO took place in a multi-purpose room designed for social\\n gatherings, roughly a 6m by 4m room with columns down the\\n middle with two long tables on either side. The VR players used the\\n Meta Quest 2 standalone head-mounted display with Meta Quest 2\\n Touch controllers. The PC players used an ASUS ROG Zephyrus\\n G15 laptop with a 15.6-inch display, Ryzen 9 5900HS CPU, GeForce\\n RTX 3050Ti GPU, and a wired three-button mouse. The spectators\\n who were not playing on devices could also watch the gameplay\\n through a laptop connected to a projector that displayed a (roughly)\\n 1.5m picture on one of the room’s walls.\\n Acron took place in a separate games room, roughly a 15m by\\n 6m space with benches on either side. We used the Meta Quest 3\\n standalone head-mounted display with the Meta Quest Touch Plus\\n controllers for the VR user. Each person used their mobile phone\\n to play the Phone side of the game. There was no projector set up\\n in this room.\\n 3.4 Participants\\n We used convenience sampling to recruit participants during an\\n international seminar on Social XR: The Future of Communication\\n and Collaboration. This seminar gathered junior and senior aca-\\ndemics and practitioners from different disciplines to address open\\n challenges of immersive interaction including the ethical, legal and\\n societal aspects of possible futures. Participation was voluntary and\\n no monetary compensation was given. Observing the seminar at-\\ntendees provided an opportunity to focus on the gameplay without\\n losing traction on initial technical difficulties typically experienced\\n by novice players who have never encountered asymmetrical cross-\\nreality interface situations. 14 participants were present for the\\n social XR games, and 9 of those completed our survey (5 women\\n and 4 men). Ages ranged from 20-29 (N=2), 30-39 (N=6), and 40-49\\n (N=1) years. Three participants self-identified as non-gamers, four\\n as casual gamers, one as a core gamer, and one as a hardcore gamer.\\n Self-identified gamer types were explorer (N=4), socializer (N=3),\\n achiever (N=1), and killer (N=1) [5].\\n 3.5 Procedure\\n We invited all seminar attendees to play DAVIGO while socializing\\n in the multi-purpose room. Participants could choose from VR, PC,\\n or spectator roles; and some people played multiple roles in dif-\\nferent game sessions throughout the evening. Although this game\\n allowed for up to four PC players, we only played with one PC\\n player for simplicity. The starting players individually completed\\n the in-game tutorial before competing against each other, while\\n spectators watched how to play on the projector. After that, the\\n reining players passed on control mappings to subsequent players.\\n The average playtime per person was about 10 minutes and the\\n game was available to play for about 1.5 hours. The next evening,\\n all researchers were invited to play Acron in the games room. Re-\\nsearchers could choose from VR, Phone, or Spectator roles. Acron\\n allowed up to eight Phone players, and we played with 4-6 Phone\\n players for each round. There were no tutorials in this game; instead,\\n players jumped right into taking turns playing the VR character. We\\n played similar average match time and total game time compared\\n   Page 5 of 9 Asymmetrical Co-located XR Gameplay CHI EA ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA\\n to DAVIGO. For both games, we took videos, photos, and obser-\\nvation notes. One week after the seminar, we sent out an online\\n questionnaire that invited researchers at the seminar who were\\n present for one or both of the game nights to complete.\\n 4 RESULTS\\n Of the nine participants who completed our survey, some played\\n only DAVIGO (N=2; both PC) or only Acron (N=2; one Phone-only\\n and one both Phone and VR), while others played both DAVIGO\\n and Acron (N=3; one played it all and two played all but PC Knight)\\n or only watched others play games (N=2). The results of the post-\\ntest questionnaire and the descriptive statistics for VR players are\\n summarized in the appendix Table 1 and Figure 3.\\n We identified three themes: inclusive gameplay–importance of\\n the spectator role, cross-reality media affordances, and the power\\n and limitations of co-located asymmetric social play.\\n 4.1 Inclusive Game Play–Importance of the\\n Spectator Role\\n Addressing RQ1, we found that asymmetrical cross-reality inter-\\nfaces levelled the playing field for gamers at different levels of ex-\\nperience and gaming styles to enjoy the game together. On average,\\n PC/Phone participants liked playing against a VR player (M=4.14,\\n SD=0.69) [Q44] and did not prefer to play only against others using\\n the same modality (PC/Phone) (M=1.14, SD=0.38) [Q45].\\n If someone did not want to play actively as a character in the\\n game for various reasons–“engaged in discussions”, “I had to work”,\\n “I don’t like playing games. I was worried I wouldn’t get the hang\\n of it fast”–they could remain involved as a spectator through pro-\\njection monitors. One participant said the lack of projection during\\n Acron made them feel like they “could not take part in the story\\n that took place, which made me feel like an outsider”, whereas with\\n the projection of DAVIGO, spectators could watch what the VR\\n player was doing and found it “fascinating.”\\n Remaining engaged as a spectator kept options open as the\\n spectator’s situation continued to shift. One participant said “I had\\n to work... but I was super glad to be able to see the rest enjoy, and\\n I watch quite often the projection.” Some participants may have\\n opted to remain a spectator due to a lack of confidence; however, we\\n observed that others gradually built self-efficacy as they watched\\n the game on the projection screen and eventually opted in to play\\n more actively. While on PC/Phone, players found it relatively easy\\n to communicate with the VR player (M=3.33, SD=1.37) [Q46] and\\n afterward wanted to try the VR mode (M=3.71, SD=1.50) [Q47]. For\\n spectators, if they had to play, they would have played VR giant\\n (N=2) or the Phone squirrel (N=1), but not the PC knight.\\n Spectators have been considered in other video game modalities\\n [32], but there has not yet been an in situ study of social settings\\n where there are more people than there are XR devices in a game-\\nplay scenario. Gaming in a casual social space with a projection\\n system casting the XR content in our pilot study allowed spectators\\n to focus on socializing or working while still being “able to see\\n casually what they were doing.” Our findings provide preliminary\\n support for game design that takes the role of the spectator into\\n account, in considering the overall social experience of XR play\\n when players are co-located.\\n 4.2 Cross-Reality Media Affordances\\n Our findings suggest that cross-reality media experiences in social\\n settings are most enjoyable when the unique affordances of each\\n medium are leveraged in the design of the game. Specifically, play-\\ning in the same room, having multiplayer capability, and having\\n different options to play (VR and PC/Phone) made the game more\\n enjoyable for the majority of participants (N=6, 66.7%). Additionally,\\n for some participants, having the projection for DAVIGO was key\\n (N=4, 44.4%) as well as playing with people you know (N=3, 33.3%).\\n One participant liked playing as the squirrel in Acron because you\\n are “part of a team.”\\n Interestingly, most of the cross-reality games we surveyed and\\n the two games that we observed in the current study opted to\\n integrate a single VR user as a giant character (in size and role),\\n relative to multiple PC and Phone users joining the same game\\n (as an attacking knight or squirrel). One participant thought that\\n “having the god-like view on the small knights was fascinating.”\\n The VR giant approach effectively addresses two conundrums of\\n media asymmetry in these games. First, even with a clear boundary\\n established, it may be difficult or dangerous for a sole VR player to\\n be moving among a group of stationary PC or Phone players. We\\n observed DAVIGO VR players running up against physical walls\\n in the tight space. Second, employing a giant character is one way\\n of alerting other users in the game that the user is on a different\\n device (i.e., VR).\\n If both VR and PC/Phone users had to play the same game char-\\nacter, the asymmetry between media features may have caused a\\n discordant play experience–for example, natural mapping in VR\\n may allow for more accurate object throwing compared to the point\\n and click of the mouse or tapping on the phone screen. Although it\\n may seem counter-intuitive, intentionally designing game features\\n to highlight these asymmetries and have users play different roles\\n in the game if they are on different devices seemed to encourage\\n users to accept the asymmetries as a natural part of the game. This,\\n in turn, contributed to an enjoyable experience for everyone in-\\nvolved. This may be why the participants, even after playing with\\n different devices for the same game, did not seem to display a clear\\n preference. For example, one participant said “I preferred to play\\n the role that was losing since it created a new challenge of being\\n the one that was able to win.” Another participant echoed these\\n words, saying “there are clear pros and cons for both types of play\\n (VR vs. non-VR) and I like each type for its own worth.”\\n 4.3 The Power and Limitations of VR for\\n Co-located Asymmetric Social Play\\n Addressing RQ2, our findings suggested that challenges came with\\n supporting asymmetric co-located play. Using multiple devices\\n brought technical challenges related to interoperability–for exam-\\nple, getting the projector to work with the laptop that is driving the\\n shared view of the game. Participants reported that “DAVIGO was\\n more fun”, but preferred Acron for its easier setup and accessibility\\n for “more non-VR players via smartphones not via PC.”\\n Bringing fully headset-immersed VR players into the mix intro-\\nduced important spatial challenges–our play sessions included the\\n practicalities of dodging pillars in the room. VR also increased phys-\\nical effort for players who opted for this modality. One participant\\n   Page 6 of 9 CHI EA ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA Kitson, et al.\\n noted that “you are physically there and performing a theatre. That\\n is uncomfortable for some and also takes a lot of physical effort\\n even if you are fine with that.”\\n The asymmetrical approach to co-located gaming with VR pro-\\nmoted enjoyable experiences for both players and spectators by\\n demonstrating to PC/Phone players and spectators the usually ob-\\nscured reality of the VR player. For some, watching others play in\\n VR helped them to see what to do and prompted their curiosity to\\n try VR for themselves. One participant commented that the pro-\\njection was “a good way of showing that a game was going on in\\n a dark room meant for another activity.” However, one limitation\\n we observed was that the VR player was blind to the presence of\\n other players and spectators in the co-located space. One spectator\\n reflected that “playing social VR games is still difficult due to the\\n unknown social dynamics and everyone gets very vulnerable being\\n the immersed person. It removes the anonymity (even if you know\\n who is behind the nickname) of playing digital games together.”\\n Findings suggested that although the VR character was one of the\\n most enjoyable experiences in the cross-reality game with high\\n presence perceived while embodying a giant, in a co-located sit-\\nuation, it also induced some anxiety and feelings of vulnerability.\\n Given the conflicting views of this role, we suspect that limiting\\n the number of concurrent VR players in the same game is likely to\\n be more conducive to an enjoyable gaming experience.\\n 5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\\n As XR devices and platforms continue to evolve and diversify, user\\n experiences and preferences regarding asymmetrical cross-reality\\n interfaces become more crucial to understand, toward designing\\n and supporting rich entertainment experiences that take legacy\\n devices into account. The current field study with attendees of an\\n international seminar on social XR yielded some critical insights\\n concerning the strengths, weaknesses, and future opportunities for\\n asymmetrical cross-reality gaming in the field.\\n Our results extend existing work that uses different combinations\\n of infrastructure to enable multiple players, spectators and multi-\\ndevice play in the same space [19, 29, 40, 57] by using a simple setup\\n of a standalone VR headset together with a laptop PC connected\\n to a projector (DAVIGO) or smart Phone (Acron). In doing so, we\\n observed that participants selected the most suitable device and\\n modality based on their gamer style and type, which is consistent\\n with this emerging body of research [3, 35, 49, 56]. In our case study,\\n participants reported high levels of embodiment and presence as\\n the VR giant. We speculate that the plasticity of body schema and\\n body ownership [50, 53] allowed users to quickly adjust to the\\n giant’s slow, cumbersome movements, suitable for social, co-located\\n gameplay in a constrained space [1, 20, 52].\\n Players enjoyed the flexibility of moving between spectating\\n and active participation, as well as the diverse play opportunities\\n that the asymmetric controls provided. Despite the headwinds of\\n added complexity involved in setup, playing these games was seen\\n as worthwhile and enjoyable.\\n Overall, this in situ \"prequel\" study helps to clarify player expe-\\nrience preferences and key design elements in asymmetrical cross-\\nreality VR games in the field. In a world in which not everyone\\n will have or want a VR headset, game developers can benefit from\\n a stronger understanding of supporting flexible play modalities,\\n including considerations of spectator appeal. Future work could\\n include expanding to include additional combinations of devices,\\n studying different sub-genres of asymmetric VR games [13], look-\\ning into remote use, and examining different demographics, for\\n example, intergenerational play scenarios and the consideration of\\n accessibility across XR users with disabilities.\\n ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\n We conceptualized the paper and ran the case study on the social\\n evenings during the Dagstuhl seminar 23482 on Social XR: The\\n Future of Communication and Collaboration (Nov 26 – Dec 01,\\n 2023). Some participants of those evenings later agreed to contribute\\n to the data sampling of this paper.\\n REFERENCES\\n [1] Parastoo Abtahi, Mar Gonzalez-Franco, Eyal Ofek, and Anthony Steed. 2019.

       "   'search_results': ['Video games have come a long way. They have morphed from simulated games of ping pong to today’s fully-immersive virtual reality games that leverage biometrics and artificial intelligence (AI). While the origins of using AI in games were simple – such as to create more realistic non-player characters – the use of AI now allows for much more. AI-based tools may be used to outsource quality assurance, gain data-driven insights into players, or to better understand player value to maximize retention and in-game revenue. Now is thus a good time for companies to keep in mind regulatory bodies’ increased focus on the use of AI.  \\nIn the US, the FTC has provided guidance around the use of AI in ways that avoid unfair or deceptive trade practices. For video game publishers, as applied to the gaming industry, the FTC’s key considerations (which we also summarized in our sister blog) include:\\n Accuracy. AI components of a game or service should be tested prior to implementation to confirm it works as-intended.\\n Accountability. Companies should think about how the use of AI will impact the end- user. Outside experts may be used to help confirm that data being used is bias-free.\\n Transparency. End-users should be made aware that the company may use AI, it should not be used secretively. Individuals should know what is being collected and how it will be used.\\n Fairness. To further concepts of fairness, the FTC recommends giving people the ability to access and correct information.\\nState comprehensive privacy laws (such as the forthcoming laws we discussed in our sister blog, namely in California, Colorado, and Virginia) will also impact companies’ use of AI. These laws require companies to provide individuals with opt-out rights regarding AI in automated decision-making and profiling. They also mandate conducting data protection impact assessments for processing activities that pose a heightened risk- such as automated processing. In line with the FTC’s transparency principle, California’s CPRA also requires access requests to include information about the logic and outcome involved in such decision-making processes. NIST (a self-regulating industry body) has also proposed an AI risk management framework.\\nAI has received similar scrutiny in Europe (discussed in our sister blog), where the focus has been on providing transparency and oversight when using AI. This is particularly true when automated decision-making occurs. Like the states noted above, here a risk-based approach will be needed. At present, an AI Act is being considered, which would take these concerns into account.',\n",

       "    \"The European Union’s AI Act is pending legislation that is classifying different AI applications across different tiers of risk, and there are a number of ways that this legislation could shape the future of how the Metaverse unfolds, especially as there could be XR privacy implications depending upon how biometric data may be redefined and what types of inferences could be made by this data. I talk with Daniel Leufer of Access Now about the human rights approach for regulating AI applications, and how some of the pending legislation drafts of the AI Act (as of January 17, 2023) may have rippling effects for GDPR and ultimately what type of biometric privacy inferences could be made from XR data. \\nWe cover the hierarchy of different AI risks, and how the AI Act is taking a tiered approach to legislating product safety of AI platforms with different requirements at different levels. He’s unpacked some of the common AI Myths as a Mozilla Fellow, and is on the frontlines of tracking the latest AI Act trilogue deliberative processes between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission (which he breaks down in further detail in this interview). \\nThe EU is anywhere between 5, 10, 15, or 20 years ahead of the United States when it comes to technology regulation, and so we reflect on the impacts and gaps within GDPR when it comes to XR Privacy, how the AI Act may or may not fill those gaps, and getting an in-depth sneak peak into how the AI Act may “become a global standard, determining to what extent AI has a positive rather than negative effect on your life wherever you may be.” There are many extensive implications about the AI Act that will likely impact the future development of XR technologies, how AI is deployed in virtual worlds, and how the Metaverse continues to develop and unfold. \\n \\n \\n This is a listener-supported podcast through the Voices of VR Patreon.  \\nMusic: Fatality \\nRough Transcript\\n[00:00:05.412] Kent Bye: The Voices of VR Podcast. Hello, my name is Kent Bye and welcome to the Voices of VR podcast. It's a podcast that's looking at the frontiers of spatial computing and some of the ethical and moral dilemmas surrounding it. You can support the podcast at patreon.com slash Voices of VR. So continuing on my series of looking at XR privacy, today's episode I have Daniel Leufer, who is a philosopher working out of AccessNow. It's a digital rights non-government organization that is based in Brussels and so it's working very closely within the European Union. So they're a global human rights organization, and Daniel actually talks a lot about the AI Act. He's been looking at this for a number of different years, and within the context of the AI Act, it's going to be creating this tiered system of what is unacceptable risks of different applications of AI. They're going to be completely banned in the context of the EU. There's these high-risk applications that are going to be regulated and have to register and be monitored, and then there's the limited risks that have different transparency obligations. And so I was particularly looking at, in what ways are the AI Act going to have specific definitions for biometric data that may actually change the way that the GDPR is interpreting biometric data? Right now, there's very much a tight coupling between biometric data and identity. And some of the different data that's going to be coming off of VR, while maybe right now it may not be personally identifiable information, it may in the future, but as of right now, there's certain inferences that you can make out of that data. And because there's so much of an emphasis on identity, then there isn't a high risk or even unacceptable risk for what companies may be able to do with some of this data. So the AI act seems to be on the frontiers of trying to define some of those things, and it's also just trying to rein in some of the different potential harms that can come from the deployment of some of these AI systems. So they're trying to wrap their head around something that's an extremely difficult issue. Daniel talks a little bit about the human rights frameworks that are trying to rein in the AI technologies and how that relates back to XR technologies and XR privacy as well. So, that's what we're covering on today's episode of the Voices of VR podcast. So, this interview with Daniel happened on Tuesday, January 17th, 2023. So, with that, let's go ahead and dive right in.\\n[00:02:22.230] Daniel Leufer: Hi, my name is Daniel Loufer. I'm Irish, but I'm based in Brussels and I work for a digital rights NGO called Access Now. We're a global human rights organization that works to protect and defend the digital rights and the human rights of users at risk around the world. So journalists, human rights activists, and we're based really all over the place. We offer a digital security helpline that provides security help 24-7 all around the year to users at risk, to our community who need help. And in the EU, we work on ensuring that European legislation, EU legislation, embeds and protects human rights, and that we also bring in the insights from the work that we do through our helpline into the policymaking process. My own background is in philosophy, actually, weirdly, so I'm mostly working with lawyers and technologists, and I am neither. But the topic I work on most is stuff that falls under the vague and problematic umbrella of artificial intelligence. But it's a topic, I think, that intersects with so many different things that everyone's expertise is really valuable, and it's not a solely technical or legal domain. So very interesting.\\n[00:03:38.937] Kent Bye: Yeah, well, I'm really excited to talk to you to get a little bit of an update as to some of the major things that are happening from the EU perspective with regards to things like the AI Act that is imminent sometime in the first part of 2023, as I understand. But there's also an upcoming virtual world initiative or aka the metaverse initiative. There's also the GDPR, which has obviously been a huge impact of trying to bring about more sophisticated privacy architectures and privacy engineering around the world. even if here in the United States, we don't get all the benefits of something like the GDPR, it at least is getting the big technology companies to change their architecture. I'm particularly interested in a lot of things around biometric data and inferences of that that are coming from XR. And I think there's the complex of things from both GDPR and the AI Act and some potential metaverse initiative things that may be coming down the road. But before we dive into all of those things, I wanted to give you an opportunity to give a little bit more context as to your background and say like the philosophy of technology or political philosophy and how your own journey of looking at some of these regulatory issues, how you're working with this human rights organization to bring about this human rights approach to technology and working with the EU. So I'd love to hear a little bit more about your journey of where you're at now and what you're doing.\\n[00:04:55.198] Daniel Leufer: Great. Yeah. So I studied philosophy and literature. That was my initial background. And then I took a year out after my bachelor, which turned into five years. And then I decided to, you know, give academia another shot. and came to Belgium, which is where I've been living for almost 10 years now to do a master's in philosophy, and got straight into a PhD program. And, you know, I was generally interested in political philosophy, philosophy of technology. But funnily enough, I did my PhD on a program, an EU funded program that was focused on the First World War and philosophy. So I was working on overlapping issues to those that I work on now, except 100 years ago, 110 years ago, at this point, almost. And that was like an interesting perspective to be looking at, you know, a really cataclysmic event that happened 100 years previously, and how that sort of supercharged the adoption of certain technologies took down political regimes. It was a time of, you know, immense political change, technological change, all of these things. And seeing the kind of germs of that happening at the same time. So, you know, as I was looking at that period, things were massively happening here as well, you know, in terms of technology, that sort of coincided with the real boom in machine learning as a transformative technology. And funnily enough, I remember when I started working with Access Now after my PhD, on many occasions, I said something like, you know, it'll just take some kind of transformative global event to massively change the uptake of technologies in the way that the First World War did and then COVID hit. And that's precisely what we saw in a lot of domains, you know, huge uptick in digitalization, all of these different things spurred on by that event. So the parallels were pretty interesting, but I generally found that, I mean, when people say they leave academia, it's kind of an easy thing to leave because there's no jobs. Um, but I definitely felt more drawn to activism to really engaging with things that are happening right now, rather than and you know, there are obviously many fantastic activist academics. But in terms of the environment, I was really attracted to working in something that was a bit more hands on. And I happened to read a review of Virginia Eubanks book, Automating Inequality, probably the second last year of my PhD. And that just was like an explosion going off in my head where I realized that a lot of the political philosophy of politics types questions that I was very interested in were being posed in, you know, really urgent ways by these technologies that sort of fall under that umbrella of AI. And it just seemed like a really urgent, important and juicy topic to get into. And yeah, I don't know, I guess the stars aligned pretty well in that once I finished my PhD, I had actually started learning to program. I was like, okay, I really need a job. So I had been, you know, learning some JavaScript and stuff, and actually met, I want to give a shout out to Fabian Beneteau, who's an XR developer, met him at the place where I was learning to program and went for lunch and had a chat about AI and VR. And I had this idea to run a reading group on philosophy of technology, which ended up being on Zuboff's Surveillance Capitalism. And I simultaneously had this idea to bring technologists to the university I was at, KU Leuven, to talk to philosophers. And he proposed the idea, why don't we do something in VR? And we actually did. I can maybe dig this up if he's got a link to it. We did a VR trolley problem. And it was quite a cool talk and Fabian came and he gave a talk about VR. And we actually bought a lot of really rudimentary cardboards to get everyone to try out this trolley problem that he put together. So that was like my first taste of VR. And then around the same time, I saw that Access Now was actually looking for an intern to work on the EU at the time, at this high level expert group on AI. And FunnyHitVeggie, my colleague, was on that expert group at the time. And AccessNow was quite skeptical about this ethics guidelines approach to regulating AI. And they were looking for someone to kind of help out with that. And as someone with more of a political philosophy background, I was also quite sceptical about this idea of ethics guidelines and self-regulation and stuff like that. Obviously, I think there were a lot of philosophers, ethicists who were quite flattered to be suddenly very relevant. I think, yeah, just there was an instant click between me and Access Now in having this more critical perspective on the kind of AI ethics boom that was happening at the time. yeah, that really worked well. And while I was at Access Now, I applied to be a Mozilla fellow, and put forward this project idea that, you know, a lot of what I was seeing working with Access Now was that you spend so much time, and to be honest, it's less today, in policy discussions around AI, you spend so much time myth busting, just pushing back against these, you know, misguided ideas about what AI is, what it can do. And the basic aim of the project was to sort of crowdsource what are the worst myths and misconceptions about AI, and then work collaboratively with people to develop resources for civil society organisations to help them kind of crack through that because it was a time, so this is like 2018, 2019, when a lot of civil society organizations who maybe had been working on data protection and other issues for a long time, were suddenly faced with AI. And it's a joke I always make that if you see an academic or organization that has a project that acquired funding in 2016, it's all big data. If it was 2018, it's all AI. And there was just this shift and you're often you're talking about the same thing, but the discourse shifted. And it's interesting as well, because you had just had the adoption of the GDPR. And it was a time when if you said data protection, You know, you said regulation, you didn't say data protection, voluntary guidelines. And then suddenly everyone was doing AI and it was like ethics guidelines. And, you know, you had this mushrooming of like hundreds of sets of ethics guidelines. And so we were there at that time as Access Now and other partner organizations, Article 19, different people kind of pushing back and saying, no, no, no, no, no. we need regulation, we need human rights protections. This is not something that self-regulation can get by. So that's the transition briefly in the way that it happened for me that, yeah, right place at the right time, I think.\\n[00:12:11.313] Kent Bye: Yeah, that's a really great context for your own journey, but also I think connects a lot of things that I've come my own journey in terms of trying to figure out just this issue of privacy and XR and how there's no federal privacy law in the United States, but there is a general data protection regulation that GDPR that was made from the EU. And, you know, I went to the American Philosophical Association Eastern meeting 2019 and saw Dr. Anita Allen give the presidential address and was on the philosophy of privacy and digital life. And in the writeup that she did for that talk, she pointed to this paper that the EU did in 2015, it's called Towards a New Digital Ethics. And so it's trying to take this human rights approach of trying to take these fundamental human rights to inform the regulations that were being developed. And so I feel like that's something that's unique and different for what the EU is doing. And so since you're at Access Now, which is the host of RightsCon and other human rights organizations around the world, facilitating this community of technologists and policymakers and philosophers, academics, trying to look at this intersection between technology and society through policy, but with a specific lens of human rights. So I'd love to hear a little bit of your take of this connection between the human rights and taking a human rights approach to regulation and why that seems to be a good approach contrasted to maybe some other approaches that are taken\\n[00:13:33.278] Daniel Leufer: Yeah, no, it's a really interesting topic to dig into. And to be honest, it was one of the main things that occupied, I would say, the first couple of years that I was in the space. And it's really interesting to look back now, because the idea of regulating AI, of human rights and AI is so taken for granted at this point, but it wasn't at the time. It was really It's the result, I think, of a lot of hard work by a lot of people to push back against some of the other frameworks. And not to say that the human rights framework is the only one to view things through, you know, it has its limitations, but I think there's obviously some bad frameworks to approach things through. And that's what we were trying to fight against. And I mean, very concretely, what we were seeing a lot of at the time in these companies, self-generated AI ethics guidelines, was more of a utilitarian approach. And human rights frameworks are more deontological. So rather than a utilitarian approach, which is going to be looking at how do we maximize the benefit, maximize the good, minimize the bad, ensure that there's a net benefit to applications. With the human rights approach, you tend to be looking more at absolute or at least principles that need specific criteria in order for them to be infringed upon or to allow exceptions. So, just to take a concrete example, I like to think about the concept of automated gender recognition. This is a topic that we've campaigned on and our work in this area is built, essentially trying to operationalize the work of scholars like Oz Keyes, big shout out to Oz, Morgan Schuurman, different scholars like this who have looked at how automated gender recognition systems, which is essentially some kind of an AI system that is inferring your gender from some kind of observable data, And, you know, they vary in complexity, you have really stupid ones, like there was one a while, few years ago, that claimed to be able to infer gender from people's names, just like a total disaster, and was really bad, down to, you know, much creepier ones that are inferring gender from facial structure or from your gait, different things. And you'll often hear companies who push these things or governments who deploy them citing things like accuracy rates. And they'll say something like, this is 90% accurate, it's 95% accurate. And if you're coming at that from a utilitarian point of view, you're maybe going to look at, okay, say this is a system that controls And actually, I'm struggling to come up with a good example of what you could use an automated gender recognition system for because they don't have a good application. But a really horrible application is to control bathroom access. So that outside of men's and women's toilets, you would have a facial recognition system that infers someone's gender and then opens the door if it matches. If you're coming at it from a utilitarian perspective, you might say, right, if it's 95% accurate, that's great. Maybe it doesn't work for a few people. But, you know, overall, this is a net benefit. This makes things seamless, whatever, for people who are trying to access it. But I think if you're coming at it from a human rights perspective, or just a genuinely humane perspective, you go, who are the 5%? Is it a random selection of people? No. Is it someone like me? A cishet white guy? No. it's a 5% of people, it's the same group of people who face discrimination daily. And here, I'm really pirating Oski's work here. It's a subset of people who face discrimination on a daily basis in all sorts of other places, the job market, housing market, education, workplace, everything. And you're discriminating against them. And you're actually, if you think about these systems, they tend to classify people usually according to a gender binary, male or female. What about if you're non-binary? You're just not classified. Your existence is invalidated by these systems. They also tend to misgender people, trans people, women with darker skin. And when you think about it like that, you go, this thing is actually designed to discriminate against those 5% of people. And that I think if you have a framework that sort of incentivizes you to look at things from that perspective, it's a much more powerful perspective and a more just perspective than having these kind of often perverse utilitarian calculations. And, you know, someone might say that's a bit of a caricature of utilitarianism. There's obviously more sensible versions with more safeguards built in. But there are some quite caricature utilitarians out there making some calls. Our analysis, and again, this is building on the work of Oz and others, but from a human rights perspective, I think if you look at a technology like automated gender recognition, The conclusion that you'll come to is not, oh, this is fine because it generally works for most people. It's like, this shouldn't be allowed. It violates this subset of people's rights to such an egregious extent that it is not permissible to deploy something like that. And that's something that we'll come back to if we talk about the AI Act a bit later, this idea that certain systems should be prohibited. But that was a bit the battleground. And there's obviously very important critiques of the human rights framework from a decolonial perspective, from a racial justice perspective, all of these other you know, really valuable additions to expand the framework of the way that we see things. But I think the types of sort of simplistic utilitarianism that dominated a lot of those AI ethics guidelines back in 2016, 2017 was definitely a much inferior way to look at things. And I think it's really nice to see that you don't get a lot of that These days, the proviso I will add, though, is, as I'm sure you're well aware, we're entering another peak of AI hype with chat GPT and everything. And the utilitarianism is very strong in a lot of quarters with defective altruism, long termism, all of this stuff. So I definitely I'm bracing myself for a few more years, going around to, you know, bringing a human rights perspective to this new generation of generative AI systems. But yeah, that's more or less how that bottle went up. And, you know, it's interesting what you point out as well about the Anita Allen reference and, you know, huge props to Anita Allen there. She's absolutely fantastic. The fact that the EU was pushing this idea of an ethical approach to technology that was grounded in human rights. That is something we saw as well in the ethics guidelines for trustworthy AI, which were the first step in the process that got us to where we are now with this AI Act regulation. It was ethics based in human rights. And that was interesting, because it was specifically taking this deontological approach, not a utilitarian approach. But as we and many other people pointed out at the time, that was fine for what it was as a step towards regulation, but it needed to only be a step. It couldn't be the final product. And thankfully it wasn't. So our worries were assuaged on that point.\\n[00:21:14.603] Kent Bye: Yeah, I want to tie this back into XR to some degree, because my primary concern is around the types of data that are made available by XR devices, virtual reality, augmented reality, and the type of physiological and biometric data that's being radiated. Britain Heller has written a paper that she's arguing that a lot of ways that biometric data is typically thought of is if it's being able to identify someone. So the biometric privacy law that's in Illinois, United States is also very much defining biometric data as data that is able to tie you back to your personal identity. And as I was reading through the draft of the AI Act, there was a number of different things in there, like, say, the prevention of using real-time biometric information to be able to do facial recognition and identify people in the context of law enforcement, as an example of saying how you're talking about the utilitarian aspects. Well, if those 5% of people, if the effect of the system failing means that you're putting people in prison who are actually innocent, then that's a violation of human rights that has been such an egregious level that you're saying that all of these biometrically determined facial recognition, the band biometric surveillance movement, trying to eliminate these different types of use cases of this band access. But I guess what I'm worried about in some ways with XR technologies is the type of stuff that Britton Heller points out, which is the more of the biometric psychographic information, which is information that you're able to make inferences upon this data that is more real-time information, contextual, about your likes, your dislikes, your preferences, that isn't always necessarily tied to your identity, but it's still what I think of as the human rights approach of neuro rights, which is trying to protect a number of different rights, five of them that they list, the ones that I really focus on in terms of neuro rights and neuro privacy are your mental privacy. And then once you map out your mental privacy, and what you're thinking, then you move into your identity. So it's the mapping of all these different aspects of your identity, and then to agency. So once you have a complete map of somebody being able to nudge their behaviors and undermine their rights to free will or rights to agency, so you have this complex of mental privacy, identity and agency, they're all tied into this. And I was hoping to some degree, that the AI Act would start to address some of these gaps, because I don't know if this is necessarily even covered in GDPR. It may be. So I'd love to hear some of your take of how you see this future of privacy and these biometric inferences that may be coming and if they already are covered with GDPR or if there will be a need for something additional and something like the AI Act or something with this upcoming virtual worlds initiative or metaverse initiative that's coming from the EU.\\n[00:23:54.649] Daniel Leufer: Yeah, great. I can say as well that I was so happy listening to your podcast that you focus on this issue, because it's one of the issues I've been shouting about for years as well. And I, you know, really love Britain's work as well. I think it's been so important to highlight what Andrew McStay, who's a fantastic scholar who does amazing work on emotion recognition, in particular, has called this dichotomy of identity-based harms versus inference-based harms. And that I think XR is really a domain where you see much more scope for these inference-based harms, where the issue isn't just you're identified, it's the inferences that are made about you. And you know, which is also a broader conception of identity, like my identity is not just my legal identity, my name, but all of these aspects about me. But right, loads to unpack here and one of my favorite topics. So let's get into it. Maybe I'll start with biometric data. So in the GDPR, biometric data is defined in a weird way. And the protections for biometric data under Article 9 are defined in an even weirder way. So the definition of biometric data has two parts, and this is precisely the issue that Britain points to in our paper. It's physiological, physical, or behavioral data resulting from a specific technical processing that allows or confirms unique identification of a person. Now, that was from memory, so the precise wording may be slightly different, but that's the gist of it. And you can say that there's three things that you really need to pay attention to there. There's physical, physiological, and behavioral. which is quite broad. So it's something obvious, like my face, the physical, physiological, I guess, is more things like maybe heart rate, eye movement, different things like this. And but it also then with the behavioural, it also includes things like keystrokes, which can again be used to identify someone. And then there's the part that is also very important that resulting from a specific technical processing. So there's all sorts of complex questions that we should not get into now about whether a photograph is biometric data. Typically, you're talking about a process where, you know, if you take a facial recognition system, it's going to capture an image of your face somehow. Either it's uploaded, or it's from a camera, or something like that. And then it turns that into a biometric template. And this is some numerical representation of the main features of the face. And then some form of processing is going to be done on it. If it's a biometric identification system, like a one-to-many matching system, then the template that's been extracted from that raw data is going to be compared against a watch list of suspects that they're looking for, for example. Or, we talked earlier about automated gender recognition, an inference is going to be made about your gender. something like that. Then there's this issue that allows or confirms unique identification. This is, for me, the definition of biometric data should have stopped just before that. This allows or confirms unique identification is very, very tricky because the type of data that allows or confirms unique identification changes in line with technological developments. In 2008, for example, you needed a pretty straight, you know, looking directly at camera, high resolution photo. And, you know, the legacy of that is the type of passport photos, you know, you have these quite strict things, you know, the lighting needs to be good, all of that. Because actually, to do this type of automated matching, you needed the photo to fulfill very specific conditions. Today's facial recognition systems can do identification from incredibly blurry, oblique angles, all sorts of stuff. And so that oblique blurry photo may not have been biometric data in 2008, it is now. And that also poses huge problems because data which was collected back then would not be biometric data. If they still have it, which they shouldn't, they should have deleted it. It is now. And that's also very difficult. We were just giving comments on a proposed French law about using smart video surveillance during the Olympics. And this is one of the issues that I pointed out in our comments is that they basically claimed we will not process any biometric data, but they want to do intelligent video analysis of people in public spaces. And the comment I left was like, that will allow unique identification at some point if it doesn't already, and you cannot guarantee that. So if you're processing physical, physiological, or behavioral data about people, that should be biometric data and it should be protected as such. The second point on GDPR is Article 9, which is the famous prohibition with many exceptions on the processing of certain types of data. Under that is things like data revealing sensitive characteristics like sexual orientation, and then also biometric data for the purposes of identification. And that's quite a weird, there's a list in Article 9 of types of data. And that's a bit of an outlier because the other ones are just types of data. But the prohibition on the biometric processing is a type of data used for a specific purpose. which is kind of nonsense or circular, you know, why don't you just prohibit the identification of people using personal data? It's very circular and a bit strange. And I mean, in a way, these definitions are often consequences of the not ideal process of lawmaking, you know, where different legislative bodies are proposing amendments and compromises and stuff like that. So all in all, the definition of biometric data in the GDPR could be better. Then with the AI Act, We've been trying to highlight this issue that you raised since the beginning. As you noted, and maybe for listeners, just a kind of a quick explanation of what the AI Act does, is it regulates putting AI systems on the market and deploying them within the EU. It's not the type of legislation we dreamt of, because it's product safety legislation. And using product safety legislation to protect people's human rights is a challenge that I have been deeply immersed in for the last two years. And, you know, one of the big things we wanted was prohibitions on certain uses of AI. And you pointed to the one of what's referred to in the text as remote biometric identification. So essentially a one-to-many matching system could be used in a public space, a stadium, a concert venue, to match everyone who passes through. So everyone who enters the public space has that kind of process. Their biometric template is extracted, matched against a watch list. um, this would be prohibited, except there's some exceptions. But one of the things that caught our eye immediately, and we sent a lot of comments before the legislation came out, asking for emotion recognition to also be prohibited. And something along the lines of what Britton Howard talks about with biometric psychography, except you know, certainly restrictions to be placed on it, but for the particularly egregious forms of it, like things like, and we've seen papers out there where people claim to be able to infer sexual orientation from people's faces, to infer criminality. And often when I say that, people assume what I just said is, check if someone matches a criminal database. No, I really mean like the worst physiognomy, like 19th century evil racist pseudoscience stuff of like, maybe there's a particular criminal face. and we can infer who's likely to be a criminal using AI. And I mean, the state of machine learning research is so bad that I've seen papers that kind of implicitly recreate the theories of 19th century physiognomists. I actually saw a paper that literally its aim was to use scissor lumbroses, and I always get his name wrong. I'm always unsure if I got his name right. It was, you know, the godfather of racist pseudoscience, like saying criminals have this type of nose and, you know, literally trying to take his typology of criminal and degenerate faces and train machine learning to recognize it. Like unironically, this is the type of stuff we see in machine learning research. So we wanted that stuff as well, which is not about identity based terms. It's about the type of inferences that AI systems could be used to make about us. We also thought that should be in the prohibitions. It didn't happen. I heard that at certain points during the negotiation process, it was there. And here's a first note on EU lawmaking is that the Commission, the EU Commission, European Commission is the body that proposes a law. It's the executive body. But it has many different DGs. So different departments, essentially, you know, one devoted to borders and security, DG Home, they often have really kind of 1984 type, you know, euphemistic names, like DG Home is the one that keeps refugees out of the EU. DG Just actually is the one that's devoted actually to protecting people's rights. DG Connect, you know, will be more focused on technology, innovation and stuff. And so even within the Commission, you have different bodies with different interests, you know, arguing amongst each other, trying to come up with a law that works for all of them. So, you know, there were debates about this, but in the final text, it didn't appear. What did happen, though, is that emotion recognition and biometric categorization are in the law. So they're both defined in the law. As well as, you have the prohibitions, which is very few things. And we're working actively to try to make sure that that list is expanded. And then you have a list of high-risk AI. And basically, there's Annex 3 to the regulation that lists high-risk use cases. And if you do one of those things, that could be something like you know, a lot of police uses, migration use cases, some things maybe controlling access to AI hiring software, AI proctoring, stuff like that would fall under the high risk. Then you have to, you know, you're subject to certain transparency regulations, data quality, all of these obligations that are supposed to ensure that risks are mitigated. That's like the second level of risk. And then there's like a final level of risk. under Article 52, which is systems oppose the risk of manipulation. And that's where biometric categorization and emotion recognition ended up, along with deep fakes and chatbots. I think it's been a while since I looked at Article 52. But essentially, the only obligation that was applied to emotion recognition and biometric categorization in the original draft is that users of an emotion recognition system or a biometric categorization system had to inform the people who were subjected to them of the operation of the system. And by user here, it's the technical term in the act for an entity that's deploying a system. So it's not like the AI Act doesn't apply to everyday people. You know, if I have some AI software on my phone and I use emotion recognition on you, Kent, I am not obligated under the AI Act to inform you of that. But it's more like if a bank is using it or something like that, they have to inform people that they're interacting with it. This for us is just absolute, like so far below what needs to happen. You know, it's, I mean, if someone is using an AI system to infer my sexuality, I don't want to be told about them. I want them not to do that. I want that not to be a thing that anyone can do in the EU. Arguably, it already falls foul of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the EU, of anti-discrimination regulation, all of these sorts of things. But we want an explicit acknowledgement in the AI act, that some of these things are just so at odds with the essence of certain fundamental rights that they need to be banned. The other thing, and this is directly to your concern about the definition of biometric data, is that emotion recognition and biometric categorization were defined as, and here I'm paraphrasing the exact wording, but say biometric categorization was an AI system that is used to classify people according to certain categories. And they gave a list on the basis of their biometric data. Alarm bell. Because you can categorize someone using data about their physical, physiological, or behavioral aspects, which may not meet that bar for identification. So there will be types of biometric categorization that would actually not fit the definition because it's tied to that high bar of allows or confirms unique identification. Same with emotion recognition. So we raised the alarm immediately when we saw this. We said, the obvious thing for us was you need to change the definition of emotion recognition and biometric categorization. Things have gone in a different route that is interesting. And here, I unfortunately have to explain more about the EU legislative process. So the Commission puts out their first draft, and then they usually do an open public consultation. You can respond as a citizen, whoever wants to respond. Companies will respond, law enforcement agencies. Then you have the European Parliament, which is the democratically elected body. And they tend to be not always more amenable to human rights concerns than the other bodies. The other body then is the Council of the EU, which is essentially the Council of Member States, the 27 Member States of the EU. It's the most opaque of the three bodies, tends to be harder to communicate with that, whereas the Parliament, for the most part, is more of an open process. You know, you can watch debates, have access to documents to a much greater extent than you can at the Council. Council also tends to be, these are absolutely not absolutes, but pushing more of a law enforcement type agenda. So we were, for example, very worried that the already underwhelming ban on remote biometric identification in the first draft would be made a lot worse by the council, better by the parliament. And then at the end of this co-legislative process, the three bodies have to get together in a process called trilogues and hammer out a compromise version of the piece of legislation. And obviously all sorts of lobby groups, interest groups, academics are involved in this process. So it's quite lively and sometimes even fun to be involved in. But what happened with the definition of biometric categorization and emotion recognition is that the council actually changed the definition of biometric data. Which for us was really a surprise. So we certainly submitted comments to various member states to say, and by we here, I mean Access Now, of course, but we've also been working in an amazing coalition of civil society organizations. And so we, in all of these cases, is referring to that coalition with Access Now within Europe is a member of European Digital Rights, which is a network organization of digital rights organizations in Europe. We also share an office in Brussels and some other great organizations like Algorithm Watch, who are a German-based organization that do really great work on use of automated systems in Europe. European Disability Fund Forum, it's also an umbrella organization of organizations representing people with disabilities. Amnesty International, so loads of other organizations. And Yeah, interestingly, they changed the definition of biometric data and they did exactly what I said it should be. They deleted the part about allows or confirms unique identification. I still am trying to find out what it would mean if that ended up in the final draft of the AI Act. I said at the beginning, I'm not a lawyer, so any listener don't crucify me for legal imprecision. But the AI Act is a lex specialis on the GDPR. So it has interaction in a formalized manner with the GDPR. And it's not clear to us and we want to find out more information. about if the definition were changed in the AI Act, would that mean that the definition is actually then broader as a whole for everything that falls under the GDPR, which would be a fantastic outcome. So the Council text is finalised for the moment, and it has this better definition of biometric data in it. In the Parliament, we took a different approach. We actually Yeah, I won't get into the details. We had a version of a thing that we thought worked. And then another professor, Christiana Venderhorst, proposed adding a new definition of something called biometrics based data, which is essentially, you know, if you have the definition of biometric data, that's a bit restricted. And then you have all the other physical, physiological, and behavioral stuff that doesn't fit that. It's like a catch-all for all of that. So it would encompass everything that fits in biometric data and all the stuff that doesn't allow unique identification. So we decided to support that eventually because it got more traction than the solution we were proposing. And that is in the Parliament approach is still under discussion, but it's in the Parliament approach and it looks like it's going to be there. The definition of emotion recognition and biometric categorization were also changed so that it's on the basis of biometric data or biometrics based data, with the idea that then that catches everything. That's as far as it goes, I think, with the definitions. And then to round that off, I mean, what we've been proposing be added to the list of prohibitions is a ban on emotion recognition. We can get into discussing this a bit more. But that was a really interesting discussion because we started from that. And when we started talking to people about the idea of proposing a ban on emotion recognition, the big pushback that we got immediately was, well, you know, it's actually really useful for people with autism. And we thought, okay, we don't want to be pushing a ban on something that's potentially really beneficial as an assistive technology. So a huge shout out to Sarah Chander from Edry, who has done this incredible coalition building. You know, often digital rights organizations maybe only work together. And she's been doing amazing work to talk to, you know, organizations that represent sex workers, that represent migrants, people with disabilities, and actually built up all these incredible contacts with people outside of the digital rights bubble. And that's how we ended up working with Meher Hakobayan, who's now at Amnesty and used to be at EDF, who put us in touch with their members who were organisations representing people with autism. And it was very interesting because there were two organisations there. One of the organisations, like we looked at some research, like Oz Keys has a fantastic paper on AI and autism, which, you know, points out that it's actually typically extremely ableist. It tends to be in this perspective of trying to teach autistic people to express emotion in a neurotypical way, which assumes that their expression of emotion is somehow flawed. And so we went and talked to this one organisation who actually tended to buy the hype a bit and, you know, did say, no, we do think it's actually useful. And then we talked to another organisation, the European Council of Autistic People, And they were incredibly informative to talk to and really were of the opinion that this is a totally ableist approach. This is not something that we want. Autistic people do not need AI to help them teach or to express the emotions we need. And you're a typical people to open their minds a bit and learn how to communicate with us. So that was super interesting. And they actually gave comments, critical comments on our paper. But very funnily, what happened was they said, so we don't need it, but actually blind people do. And then we talked to a blind people's organization. They were like, no, not something we need either, but you should talk to blind and deaf people. We emailed them as well, and they were like, no, not something we need either. So there's like a general assumption that emotion recognition has value as an assistive technology. But when you start to look at the actual things being proposed, and talk to the people who it's supposed to help, then again, that's not 100%. There are, of course, autistic people out there who do think it's of benefit. But the whole narrative starts to collapse a bit. So what we've ended up proposing there is a ban on emotion recognition, if as an assistive technology, it could fulfill certain conditions, including like clinical validity, all of these different things, then there should be scope to allow an exception. But we haven't found or heard of anything that would match up with that. Then on biometric categorization, what we've proposed is a ban on all forms of biometric categorisation in publicly accessible spaces. And I use publicly accessible spaces quite broadly here in the AI Act. It's not just a place like a park or public square, also includes ticketed venues. So you know, concerts, sports games, different things like that, anywhere that you can get into, even if you have to pay. Because we believe that it's not only being identified in public, that's a problem. And that's obviously a problem if you're falsely identified. But even if you're correctly identified, or even the chilling effect of knowing that there's a protest against the government's new plan, am I going to go? Well, I'm going to be identified. They're going to know I'm there. This is a chilling effect that kind of undermines our right to freedom of assembly and association, freedom of expression. But aside from identification, if you have a system and literally there are companies in the EU proposing systems that do ethnic origin detection, which is complete rubbish. Like you cannot do that in a reliable way with the system. But even if you could, it's horrific. I mean, that's ethnic profiling. How are you going to use that? And I mean, I don't have to do too much imaginative work to imagine how police forces might use that. Or, you know, owner of a shopping centre or a mall If it sees people who look, you know, in Brussels, you typically have a huge amount of discrimination against people from the Maghreb from North Africa. If like, you know, more than 10 North African males under the age of 30 entered the space, a security guard is called. That's so dangerous. And no one's identified there, you're categorised. So we want this ban. And again, you can keep moving to proxies, you know, even if it's not explicitly identifying ethnic origin, if it's like some kind of hairstyle, or shabby clothes, you know, there's all of these proxies for protected categories, and they can always shift to that. And we've seen them do it, you know, the typical thing that we've seen is if we call out a company for offering something like ethnic origin detection, it disappears from the website. So you know, they're slippery, and they'll change to dodge whatever criticisms is coming at them. And then the final one, I'll stop after this is, this one was hard to figure out. It was like, I think everyone, or all the people we work with, we're pretty sure that there's things you can do with AI that are horrific and are an absolute violation of the essence of our rights. Determining someone's political orientation from their face. Really, the worst type of stuff, the stuff that the human rights framework was designed to stop, the type of profiling based on biometrics that the Nazis did. you know, measuring people's noses, that's what these systems do. And then making inferences about your life chances, you know, all of these inferences are extremely dangerous. But defining it in legal language is really tricky. And like not catching legitimate forms, you know, there are definitely maybe medical applications or something like this, you can use AI to analyze biometric data to detect some kind of a heart problem. How do you define what you want to ban that you don't include that, but you do include the problematic stuff? We came up with wording, went through many, many iterations. It might not be perfect, but basically a ban on using AI systems to infer categories people according to a defined list of protected categories, gender, sex, sexual orientation, political orientation, other stuff like that. what happens then is you can basically propose amendments to MEPs, so members of the European Parliament, and then they had a deadline to table amendments by. And we got very wide support for this stuff. So it's all in the amendments in the Parliament process, and the rapporteurs on the file, so the MEPs who are in charge of the file are currently working on compromises. So basically developing the Parliament's position. And we're hearing positive things about the fact that these amendments are going to make it into the Parliament text. Then it goes to trilogues. And, you know, we have to have faith in the negotiating power of those MEPs. But yeah, things can go many different ways at trilogues.\\n[00:50:12.322] Kent Bye: Well, I got another call in a couple of minutes that I got to hop off for, but just as a kind of a final thought, it sounds like that there's still some loopholes potentially for the types of concerns that I have in terms of the ways that technology companies with adhesion contracts that people sign and consent to the type of profiling that's happening there with the broader use case of surveillance capitalism. It sounds like whilst there may be some protections for certain use cases for GDPR and the AI Act, there's still some loopholes for the types of surveillance capitalism business models that may be moving forward, especially with XR technology data. Is that true?\\n[00:50:48.259] Daniel Leufer: Yeah. And I mean, the AI Act is not going to solve all the problems. It's a kind of a shot we've got to, in an ideal case, get some transparency measures, some responsible development practices kind of set as a baseline, and some things prohibited. But absolutely, it does not solve our problems. There, we really need to look at GDPR enforcement. And, you know, we've seen the recent rulings against Meta that are very interesting because it looks like the thing that we all knew for a long time that was true, that what they do is not GDPR compliant, is maybe being enforced. So GDPR is far from at its full power. I think there's challenges with the enforcement And again, there's been some interesting rulings on the types of data you're worried about, these things that don't meet the bar for unique identification that actually say that it should be covered by the prohibition on processing of biometric data. So it's still up in the air. We've seen some positive movement towards it. But I do think that the GDPR has a lot of untapped muscle to protect us there. And in the XR context as well, I think Outside of the XR context, there's no need for anyone to be collecting all of these crazy types of data about my eye movements, my brainwaves, all of this stuff, full body tracking. Someone might want to do it, but they shouldn't be doing it and they will not have a legal basis for it. The issue in XR is that there's actually a use case. And, you know, it is going to improve my experience. It is something I want, like I want full body tracking, I want eye tracking, because it has a defined purpose that it can be used for. And there, I think, you know, just back to like basic data protection principles, purpose limitation, that there has to be a clear purpose that is consented to, the data is used for that purpose, and then it's deleted. there's no further processing activities. That basic principle, if that was enforced, imagine what it would do to the landscape that we're in. And in XR, it makes perfect sense. Like, I could have all the data about me and just use it for that defined thing to make my experience better. But as we know, of course, that isn't what's happening. And you know, you look at meta, like, I've heard them make all of these claims in public about you know, we want privacy by design, we want these protections, and, you know, say things very like the things we've just been saying. And I've pointed out to them in public panels and stuff like, you know, you're subsidizing reality labs at an insane loss, using your surveillance capitalist business model. At some point, shareholders are going to be like, we want the money, like, and our hardware sales going to be enough. Or is the easy thing, you know, when the screws tighten, like we saw back in 2008, with Google and others, the move will be to what's familiar. And so I seriously worry about the ability to hold up those promises to do privacy by design to do things right. And then, you know, they understand what the issues are. And then, you know, there's definitely work being done to do things right. But whether it'll last in the long term is something I definitely worry about.\\n[00:54:14.501] Kent Bye: Awesome. Well, Danny, thank you so much for giving a whirlwind tour through all the different cutting edge aspects of the AI Act, GDPR, and the EU regulation of all these issues. And yeah, appreciate all your insights today. So thank you.\\n[00:54:27.038] Daniel Leufer: Great. Always a pleasure to be on a podcast that has taught me so much about XR. Yeah, really. Thank you.\\n[00:54:34.624] Kent Bye: So that was Daniel Lufer. He's a philosopher who's based in Brussels and working for a digital rights non-governmental organization called Access Now. So he's been focusing on the AI Act for the last couple of years and yeah, had a lot of really interesting insights in terms of the challenges of trying to put guardrails on this technology. He was saying that most of the different ethical approaches for the initial phases, which was the kind of more self-regulating ethics guidelines, you know, a lot of those tend to take more of a utilitarian approach, which is, you know, what is going to be the most benefit to the most people? So there's a accuracy rate of 95%. And then the question is, okay, what about the 5% that it's inaccurate for? and he's making the point that that 5% that actually is discriminated against in many other different contexts. And so it's Automating Inequality, which is a book by Virginia Eubanks called Automating Inequality, High High-Tech Tools, Profile Police, and Punish the Poor. It's a book that came out in January of 2018, and really got Daniel to go down this path of looking at how he can be involved with trying to look at these different issues of artificial intelligence and ways to kind of rein it in. So he's saying that most of the human rights approach is taking more of a deontological approach, which is setting these different rules and trying to come up with these deeper principles of the human rights principles and see how we can live into these human rights principles. And yeah, we're kind of moving from this self-generated ethics guidelines into more of this regulation regime based in human rights and looking at some of the different tiers that they have with breaking up the AI into these different tiers. What are the different applications of AI that are just completely unacceptable? What are the high-risk applications or the limited risk applications and each of these have different obligations if it's not banned outright in the European Union then what are the ways that it's regulated to be able to register and and have different reporting mechanisms that they need to show different dimensions of their data that's not have different aspects of bias or just even how are they coming to those different decisions. And then the other limited risk that has more of a transparency and it seems to be, well, I should clarify that everything I'm saying about this, the AIX seems to be still in the deliberative process and the tri-log processes within the EU regulation, which Daniel did a very great job of describing how it's like these three different bodies of the European Parliament, the Council of European Union, as well as the European Commission. Each of them have different drafts of the AI Act that they've been putting forth. There's different degrees of transparency with each of them. And at the end of it, they have to come to an agreement. And so it's through this trilogue process that they're trying to come up with some decent regulation. For the GDPR, you know, it's not like perfect legislation, but as far as trying to apply principles of human rights and then actually deploy something out there and change the architecture of these companies, I mean, it's, like I said, other podcasts, at least five to 10, 15 or 20 years ahead of where regulation here is in the United States. So as imperfect as it is, it's still like on the bleeding edge and way ahead of where anything that the United States is even thinking about some of these different things. So as it's going back and forth to all these different deliberation process, there does seem to be some drafts that are redefining how the European Union may be looking at biometric data in the future. That it's some drafts, at least at this phase, decoupled from being tied back to identity. So, once it actually gets the final draft in the language, then we'll have a little bit more information. And there's upcoming virtual world initiative and the metaverse initiative that also has the potential to create some new regulation or, as I've talked to other people, what may be more likely is that some of the existing legislation may need to be amended in order to fully encompass some of the different concerns around the new types of data that are going to be made available. So I guess the final thoughts is that this process is still happening, is still being deliberated, and that there's some potential hope for some of these concerns around neurorights and what happens with inferences from biometric data may start to be fleshed out with some of the language. And if not, then there's going to be a need for other initiatives that come after this with the Metaverse initiative and the virtual worlds initiative within the context of the European Union. that may start to highlight some of these different gaps within existing regulations and different modifications that need to be made. So I'll be digging more into some of these other EU movements in terms of regulations with both the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act, the AI Act and other ways in which that the AI Act may be influencing the future of the metaverse.

       "    \"Artificial intelligence has emerged as one of the most transformative technologies of the modern era, with the potential to revolutionize industries and reshape societies in profound ways. Business, media, academia, regulators, legislators, and consumers are beginning to coalesce around the idea that the early 2020’s have marked the start of a new technological paradigm.  This new paradigm will be at the very least as transformative as the development of social media and mobile-device ubiquity, but perhaps more akin to the profound social-cultural-economic-technological shifts that came with the dawn of the modern information age in the late 20th Century. Businesses, nation states and scientific institutions are increasingly engaged in an AI technological arms race, in which we are seeing transformative advancement in the technological capability of AI systems.  Whilst we are still most likely a way from ‘true’ machine intelligence (Artificial General Intelligence, AGI - systems that are as intelligent or more intelligent than humans), the next two decades and beyond are likely in part to be shaped by advances in this domain.  Social-cultural-economic-technological revolutions inevitably lead to regulatory change. Just as the information-age revolution eventually led to the proliferation of data regulation, so too will AI technology lead to the development of AI regulation. The revolution will be regulated.   💡   What is AI?  Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. AI can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence such as learning, reasoning, perception, and problem-solving.  Generated by ChatGPT: a Large Language Model using Deep Learning, NLP and other AI algorithms.    Since 2016, AI regulation has been emerging as an area of considerable focus in the global public policy landscape, with significant input from the OECD, the WEF, UNESCO, the G20 and the GPAI, and perhaps most importantly the development of the first legislative frameworks for AI regulation.  In this four-part deep dive into the future of AI regulation, Lucid Privacy Group explores the detail of the new approaches to AI regulation and examines the intersectionality of AI and privacy regulation, evaluating the role that privacy teams might need to (or want to) play in the future world of AI regulatory compliance:    Part 1: AI Regulation: The EU AI Act and its global implications   Part 2: AI Regulation: US, UK and other approaches   Part 3: Intersectional AI and Privacy regulation   Part 4: The future of privacy teams in AI compliance.    Part 1 AI Regulation: The EU AI Act and its global implications As AI technologies become more advanced and more ubiquitous, there is growing concern about the impact of AI on individuals and society, across a broad range of areas: product safety, equality, bias, human rights, security, workers rights, weaponization and, of course, privacy and protection of data, amongst many others. In response to these concerns, the European Union (EU) proposed in 2021 a new regulatory framework for AI, known as the AI Act.  The purpose of the AI Act is to establish a comprehensive set of rules for the development, deployment, and use of AI systems in the EU, with a particular focus on high-risk AI applications.  💡  Machine learning: These AI systems use algorithms to learn from data and improve their performance over time. They can be supervised, unsupervised, or semi-supervised.  In 2019, the European Commission made a political commitment to address the human and ethical implications of AI in the European Union, publishing the ‘White Paper on AI - A European approach to excellence and trust’.  Following stakeholder consultation, the EC proposed a legal framework for AI that is firmly rooted in foundational EU values and fundamental rights, with the following specific objectives:   Ensure that AI systems placed on the Union market and used are safe and respect existing law on fundamental rights and Union values; Ensure legal certainty to facilitate investment and innovation in AI; Enhance governance and effective enforcement of existing law on fundamental rights and safety requirements applicable to AI systems; Facilitate the development of a single market for lawful, safe and trustworthy AI applications and prevent market fragmentation.   ⚠️  Status of as of April, 2023: The EU AI Act remains in legislative process. EU parliamentarians are preparing for negotiations with the other branches of the EU government. Following which, assuming no other setbacks, lawmakers expect to bring the measure to a vote in May.   Intersectional Regulation The proposed framework cuts across a number of domains, including those related to existing EU law and is fundamentally linked to the rights and freedoms enshrined in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. The text of the proposal explicitly links the regulation of AI systems with:  The right to human dignity (Article 1) Respect for private life and protection of personal data (Articles 7 and 8) Non-discrimination (Article 21) Equality between women and men (Article 23) Rights to freedom of expression (Article 11) Freedom of assembly (Article 12) The right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, the rights of defense and the presumption of innocence (Articles 47 and 48) Workers’ rights to fair and just working conditions (Article 31) A high level of consumer protection (Article 28) The rights of the child (Article 24) and the integration of persons with disabilities (Article 26) The right to a high level of environmental protection and the improvement of the quality of the environment (Article 37)   💡  Rule-based AI: These AI systems use a set of predefined rules to make decisions or take actions based on the input data.  The framework is also directly linked to the existing suite of relevant EU law, noting that AI systems are already regulated by discrete law in various areas, including:   The certification of 'safe' products used for non-AI products under the New Legislative Framework - the EU framework for product safety. Recent data/digital governance regulations such as the Digital Services Act (DSA), the Digital Markets Act (DMA), and the Digital Governance Act (DGA). The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The Unfair Commercial Practices Directive (UCPD) for parts related to manipulation and deception. Existing consumer and national laws, such as on tort, are also relevant.   💡  Neural networks: These AI systems are modeled after the structure of the human brain and are designed to recognize patterns in data.  Innovation vs Regulation The proposed legal framework has at its core the concept of proportionality. The AI Act aims to strike a balance between addressing risks of AI without unduly hindering technological development or increasing the cost of placing AI solutions on the market. Legal intervention is tailored to situations where there is a justified cause for concern, and the framework includes mechanisms for dynamic adaptation as technology evolves and new concerning situations emerge. The commission hopes that this approach ensures a proportionate regulatory system that does not create unnecessary restrictions to trade.   💡  Robotics: These AI systems are used to control and automate physical machines and robots.  Risk-Based Approach To achieve proportionality, the AI Act is strongly grounded in a risk-based approach, utilizing explicit risk levels to trigger certain obligations and requirements for AI systems under the act. In practice this means that most AI use cases are left largely unregulated or very lightly regulated by the proposed framework, with most of the regulatory burden being placed on providers and users of ‘high-risk’ systems:    The commission believes that the vast majority of AI use cases will exist in the minimal and limited risk categories, meaning that they anticipate that most of the market will remain unregulated.   💡  Deep learning: This is a subset of neural networks that use multiple layers to extract and process complex features from data.  Outside of the explicit prohibitions, the bulk of the regulation therefore relates to high-risk systems.\",\n",
       "    'The FTC is turning its attention to ChatGPT. Outlets such as   the Washington Post   write that the US regulator is looking into OpenAI\\'s popular bot and if it\\'s breached consumer protection laws.    Earlier in the week, the FTC sent a   20-page document   to OpenAI calling on the company to address risks related to AI models. In the past, it\\'s repeatedly stressed that AI isn\\'t exempt from consumer protection laws, and its list of demands underline how seriously it takes the matter.   For video games, this investigation comes as ChatGPT (and AI in general) is being used by game developers. Though some have been using it to help with   coding   or   writing tasks  , others have concerns about it being used as a way to reduce labor and lead to more employee cuts.   According to the document, the chief concern for the FTC is if ChatGPT has caused reputational harm to consumers. Among its demands is a list of detailed descriptions for any and all complaints received by OpenAI about ChatGPT making \"false, misleading, disparaging or harmful\" about people.    The agency also called for research and test data gleaning how well consumers know \"the accuracy or reliability of outputs\" made by OpenAI tools, the way the company advertises its products, and complaint records about those aforementioned false statements.   ChatGPT has always been a target for regulation  Starting out, ChatGPT was touted as a fun little tool to create fake conversations with real-life people, or   create its own games  . But there\\'ve always been concerns about what it could mean plagiarism going forward, and its effect on the entire creative field.     Hollywood writers and actors  , for example, are both presently striking in part because of their concerns AI willl have on their respective fields. The worry is that studios will use an actor\\'s likeness without said actor\\'s explicit consent (particularly if they\\'re dead) or write scripts wholesale as a way to save money on hiring human writers.    As previously stated, the FTC has made clear it was always going to eventually make its way to OpenAI and ChatGPT. Back in   April  , chairperson Lina Khan said during a news conference on AI discrimination that \"there is no AI exemption to the laws on the books.\"   \"The FTC will vigorously enforce the law to combat unfair or deceptive practices or unfair methods of competition,\" she wrote.   The Washington Post noted that in recent months, ChatGPT has resulted in   false scandals   being spread around like actual news, and   lawsuits   regarding its damage to public figures\\' reputations.    in June, Senate Majority Leader   Chuck Schumer   called on Congress to address various AI risks similar to those raised by the FTC. At the time, he called it \"[potentially] our most spectacular innovation yet. [...] But if people don’t think innovation can be done safely, that will stifle AI’s development and even prevent us from moving forward.”    About the Author(s)       Contributing Editor, GameDeveloper.com   A Kansas City, MO native, Justin Carter has written for numerous sites including IGN, Polygon, and SyFy Wire.

       "    \"Depending on your life, everybody has different opinions on artificial intelligence and its future. Some believed that it was just another fad that was going to die out soon. Whilst some believed there was a huge potential to implement it into our everyday lives. \\nAt this point, it’s clear to say that AI is having a big impact on our lives and is here to stay. \\nWith the recent advancements in AI technology such as ChatGPT and autonomous systems such as Baby AGI - we can stand on the continuous advancement of artificial intelligence in the future. It is nothing new. It's the same drastic change we saw with the arrival of computers, the internet, and smartphones.\\nA few years ago, there was a survey conducted with 6,000 customers in six countries, where only 36% of consumers were comfortable with businesses using AI and 72% expressed that they had some fear about the use of AI.\\nAlthough it is very interesting, it can also be concerning. Although we expect more to come in the future regarding AI, the big question is ‘What are the ethics around it?’.\\nThe most developing and implemented area of AI development is machine learning. This allows models to learn and improve using past experience by exploring data and identifying patterns with little human intervention. Machine learning is used in different sectors, from finance to healthcare. We have virtual assistants such as Alexa, and now we have large language models such as ChatGPT. \\nSo how do we determine the ethics around these AI applications, and how it will affect the economy and society? \\nThe Ethical Concerns of AI\\nThere are a few ethical concerns surrounding AI:\\n 1. Bias and Discrimination \\nAlthough data is the new oil and we have a lot of it, there are still concerns about AI being biased and discriminative with the data it has. For example, the use of facial recognition applications has proven to be highly biased and discriminative to certain ethnic groups, such as people with darker skin tones. \\nAlthough some of these facial recognition applications had high racial and gender bias, companies such as Amazon refused to stop selling the product to the government in 2018. \\n 2. Privacy \\nAnother concern around the use of AI applications is privacy. These applications require a vast amount of data to produce accurate outputs and have high performance. However, there are concerns regarding data collection, storage, and use. \\n 3. Transparency \\nAlthough AI applications are inputted with data, there is a high concern about the transparency of how these AI applications come to their decision. The creators of these AI applications deal with a lack of transparency raising the question of who to hold accountable for the outcome. \\n 4. Autonomous Applications \\nWe have seen the birth of Baby AGI, an autonomous task manager. Autonomous applications have the ability to make decisions with the help of a human. This naturally opens eyes to the public on leaving the decision to be made by technology, which could be deemed ethically or morally wrong in society's eyes. \\n 5. Job security \\nThis concern has been an ongoing conversation since the birth of artificial intelligence. With more and more people seeing that technology can do their job, such as ChatGPT creating content and potentially replacing content creators - what are the social and economic consequences of implementing AI into our everyday lives? \\nThe Future of Ethical AI\\nIn April 2021, the European Commission published its legislation on the Act of the use of AI. The act aimed to ensure that AI systems met fundamental rights and provided users and society with trust. It contained a framework that grouped AI systems into 4 risk areas; unacceptable risk, high risk, limited, and minimal or no risk. You can learn more about it here: European AI Act: The Simplified Breakdown.\\nOther countries such as Brazil also passed a bill in 2021 that created a legal framework around the use of AI. Therefore, we can see that countries and continents around the world are looking further into the use of AI and how it can be ethically used. \\nThe fast advancements in AI will have to align with the proposed frameworks and standards. Companies who are building or implementing AI systems will have to follow ethical standards and conduct an assessment of the application to ensure transparency, and privacy and account for bias and discrimination. \\nThese frameworks and standards will need to focus on data governance, documented, transparent, human oversight, and robust, accurate, cyber-safe AI systems. If companies fail to comply, they will, unfortunately, have to deal with fines and penalties. \\nWrapping it up\\nThe launch of ChatGPT and the development of general-purpose AI applications have prompted scientists and politicians to establish a legal and ethical framework to avoid any potential harm or impact of AI applications. \\nThis year alone there have been many papers released on the use of AI and the ethics surrounding it. For example, Assessing the Transatlantic Race to Govern AI-Driven Decision-Making through a Comparative Lens. We will continue to see more and more papers getting released till governments conduct and publish a clear and concise framework for companies to implement. \\n \\n Nisha Arya  is a Data Scientist, Freelance Technical Writer and Community Manager at KDnuggets.

       "    'As generative AI progresses swiftly, tensions between technological advancements and data privacy regulations like Europe’s GDPR are coming to the forefront.\\nRecently, Italy’s Data Regulator banned OpenAI’s ChatGPT, alleging the company’s unlawful use of personal data. This development prompts questions about AI technology’s future and the industry’s ability to adapt while respecting privacy laws.\\nIn this article, we delve into the challenges that large language models like ChatGPT encounter and the potential repercussions for AI evolution.\\n The Building Blocks of Intelligent AI Language Models \\n Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT depend on extensive datasets to learn and produce human-like text.\\n OpenAI‘s GPT-3, for example, utilized millions of web pages, Reddit posts, books, and other sources to comprehend language and context. This abundance of data enables AI models to generate precise and coherent responses to a broad range of user inputs.\\nTo create effective language models, developers require access to a diverse array of content.\\nBy examining copious amounts of text, AI systems can discern patterns, learn syntax and grammar, and develop a grasp of contextual information. Furthermore, exposure to various writing styles and subjects is essential for producing contextually fitting and coherent responses.\\nHowever, the massive amount of data necessary for training these models often results in personal information being incorporated into these datasets.\\n OpenAI’s technical documents acknowledge that publicly accessible personal data may be included in AI training datasets.\\nThis raises concerns about privacy and the legality of using such information without individuals’ explicit consent.\\n Walking the Tightrope: Balancing AI Development and Privacy Rights \\nThe inclusion of personal data in AI training datasets lies at the core of legal challenges faced by companies like OpenAI.\\nItaly’s Data Regulator (Garante per la Protezione dei Dati Personali) recently ordered OpenAI to stop using personal data from millions of Italians, asserting the company lacks the legal authority to do so.\\nAlready the contagion of concern has spread to regulators in France, Germany and  the UK.\\nEurope’s GDPR rules regulate the collection, storage, and usage of personal data, impacting over 400 million Europeans.\\nGDPR applies to any information that can identify an individual, and even publicly available data cannot be scraped and utilized without proper consent or legal justification.\\nBesides privacy concerns, incorporating personal data in AI training sets can have other unintended consequences. AI models may unintentionally disclose sensitive information, perpetuate biases and stereotypes, or generate misleading content.\\nThese potential outcomes exacerbate the ethical and legal challenges faced by AI developers. \\n Legal Challenges: When ChatGPT and GDPR Collide \\nThe Italian Garante pinpointed four primary issues with OpenAI’s GDPR compliance:\\n1. Lack of age controls for users under 13\\n2. Potential for AI-generated incorrect information about people\\n3. No notifications to individuals regarding their data usage\\n4. Absence of a legal basis for collecting personal information for language model training\\nWith data protection regulators in France, Germany, and Ireland closely observing the situation, similar rulings could arise across Europe, possibly affecting the entire AI sector.\\nTo comply with GDPR, companies need to rely on one of six legal justifications for collecting and using personal information. These justifications range from acquiring explicit consent to demonstrating a legitimate interest in using the data.\\nIn OpenAI’s case, neither of these justifications appears to have been satisfied, leaving the company susceptible to legal action. And there could be more cases against similar AI projects in the near future.\\n Paving the Way for Responsible AI Innovation \\nThe sudden emergence of generative AI technology has caught data protection regulators unprepared. As more countries investigate AI companies like OpenAI, a clash between technological progress and privacy laws seems inevitable.\\nThe situation emphasizes the necessity for AI developers to reevaluate their approach to data collection and usage while adhering to privacy laws. To address these concerns, companies could develop ICO-recommended strategies that include:\\n– Anonymizing and de-identifying personal data: By meticulously removing personal information from training datasets, AI developers can reduce privacy risks and comply with data protection laws.\\n– Transparency and consent: Companies should be open about their collection, use, and processing of personal data. Acquiring explicit consent from individuals may help establish a legal basis for data usage.\\n– Collaboration with regulators: Engaging in discussions with data protection authorities can aid companies in understanding legal requirements and developing compliant AI systems.\\n– Investing in privacy-preserving AI research: Techniques such as federated learning and differential privacy can help developers create AI models that respect privacy without sacrificing performance.\\n– Developing industry standards: As AI technology continues to advance, there is an increasing need for industry-wide standards and guidelines addressing data protection, privacy, and ethical considerations.\\n Striking a Balance: The Road Ahead for GPT-4, AI and Privacy \\nThe ChatGPT conundrum highlights the intricate relationship between AI development and data privacy.\\nAs AI models continue to expand and learn from vast data sources, developers must devise ways to ensure compliance with data protection laws while maintaining the effectiveness and practicality of their AI systems.\\nA proactive approach involving collaboration with regulators, transparency, and investment in privacy-preserving research can help the AI industry strike a balance between innovation and privacy.\\nUltimately, achieving this balance is critical for the long-term success and acceptance of AI technology worldwide.',\n",
       "    'The European Union is preparing new regulations that could significantly impact the development and deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) platforms, according to the Financial Times. As discussions continue in Brussels regarding the proposals in the comprehensive Artificial Intelligence Act, sources indicate that the forthcoming regulation may require companies like OpenAI to disclose their use of copyrighted material in training their AI.\\n\"High Risk\" Chatbots in Focus of the AI Act\\nCentral to the EU\\'s AI Act is a four-tiered classification system that measures the risk AI technology could pose to an individual\\'s health, safety, or fundamental rights. The risk levels are unacceptable, high, limited, and minimal, each of which triggers different regulatory requirements.\\nThe rapid rise of generative AI technology has caught the attention of lawmakers due to its powerful capabilities and widespread adoption, prompting individual EU member countries to take action. Italy recently banned ChatGPT, citing alleged privacy violations, while Germany\\'s commissioner for data protection is considering a similar ban. Following Italy\\'s announcement, data protection authorities in France and Ireland consulted with the Italian data regulator to discuss their stance on ChatGPT.\\nAlthough the AI Act has not yet passed, preliminary comments from European parliament members suggest they may view generative AI art platforms, such as Stable Diffusion, and chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, as potentially hazardous innovations. In February, lead lawmakers on the AI Act proposed classifying AI platforms that use Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate text outputs without human supervision as high-risk.\\nSpecific Proposals to Regulate Chatbots under the AI Act\\nLawmakers are integrating new proposals into the AI Act to directly address the rise of sophisticated chatbots and LLMs.\\nA key proposal would compel developers of AI platforms like ChatGPT to disclose if they used copyrighted material to train their AI models. As previously reported, OpenAI has declined to share details on the training of GPT-4, much to the disappointment of AI researchers advocating for greater transparency.\\nAnother proposal under consideration would require AI chatbots to inform human users that they are not conversing with another human. With instances of people forming attachments to chatbots and some even believing they are sentient, lawmakers argue that such disclosure is a fundamental first step.\\nRegulatory Changes on the Horizon, but Not Imminent\\nIntroduced in 2021, the AI Act\\'s recent debate over additional chatbot regulations suggests that the process to finalize the law will not conclude until at least 2024. In the interim, individual EU member states continue crafting their own policies, creating a complex web of governance criteria for companies like OpenAI to navigate.\\nDragoș Tudorache, an EU parliament member leading negotiations on the AI Act, underscored the importance of regulations for ensuring safe deployment. \"It is a pioneering technology, and we need to harness it, which means putting rules in place,\" he said. \"Self due diligence by companies is not enough.\"',\n",
       "    'POOL/AFP via Getty Images  \\nBy now we have all been awash in articles about how ChatGPT can be used. The opportunities are nearly endless, from writing more articulate emails to easily exploring new subjects, building websites, and more. But, for a commercial business, what are the legal implications of using ChatGPT? In this article, I provide an overview of the legal issues any business should consider when using AI, and particularly how ChatGPT (or any other online accessible foundation model) raises these and, in some cases, new issues.\\n  The AI Legal Landscape  \\nThe legal landscape for AI is rapidly evolving, as is with any situation where governments and societies try to catch up with fast-moving technology. Ethicists have raised concerns, and these concerns and others are being addressed by governments in everything from best practice guides to outright laws. One of the earliest examples was the “right to explanation” in the GDPR, where consumers affected by an AI have a right to request a description of how the AI works. More recent developments include the US Government’s AI Bill of Rights and the European Union’s AI Act.\\n  Additional concerns for Generative AIs  \\nThe above laws are primarily focused on ensuring that AI systems protect user privacy and treat users in a fair and transparent manner. Generative AIs raise new issues. Unlike other types of AIs - Generative AIs “create” new content. I use quotes because whether this content is truly new or simply a probabilistic amalgamation of existing content is a topic of hot debate. Either way, questions now exist as to who owns new intellectual property created by an AI, whether an AI image can be copyrighted, etc.\\n  Business concerns for ChatGPT (and like services)  \\nNow that these services are available in API form, and countless apps are popping up using these APIs, what should your business pay attention to?\\n  Privacy : If you are using an online API - make sure that the data that you are passing to this API does not include anything your customer would consider private. For example, if you have a chatbot on your website that is really a wrapper for a ChatGPT API - your customer is conversing with ChatGPT without knowing about it. That can lead to privacy issues down the road.\\n  Intellectual Property:  ChatGPT can write code. If your engineers use it to write code, and that code ends up in your product, it is possible that your company does not own the code for your product. This is also true for image-based generative AIs. To limit business risk, you should be aware of the legal opinions on these issues in whatever geographical regions your business (or partners) operate in. In today’s globalized world, laws in any part of the world are a factor for any multinational - regardless of where the company is headquartered.\\n  Bias Issues:  Like all large AI models, the vast data used for training implies that models can include many forms of hidden biases that are very difficult to detect. If these biases find their way into your services, they will cause business risk.\\n  Regulation:  Some heavily regulated industries (such as finance and healthcare) already have strict rules for what AIs can be used. The AI Act classifies AI-powered products into different risk levels and specifies review and testing requirements for each. Depending on what product or service you are using ChatGPT for, different levels of scrutiny may apply. For example - the European Union is currently engaged in a debate about whether ChatGPT violates the AI Act, with each country’s regulators taking a different position.\\n  Right to Explanation:  Some laws require that businesses provide the right to explanation - meaning that a user can expect a human-understandable explanation of how an AI made a decision affecting them. While research on explainability is advancing rapidly, explanations for these large language models are still a challenge.\\n  What if I build my own Large Language Model?  \\nNote that some of these issues will continue to occur if you decide to build your own large language model. The privacy issues will not occur since you are not sharing with an external API and the Intellectual Property issues should also not occur. The other issues, however, will remain.\\n  Takeaways  \\nThis is an evolving space. The models are changing rapidly, and the laws around them are also changing rapidly. Interpretations of even existing laws are open to debate, and until court cases occur and judges are forced to make decisive interpretations, the debate will likely remain. Awareness of these issues, and how they may affect your company’s products and services, is a good first step.']}},\n",
