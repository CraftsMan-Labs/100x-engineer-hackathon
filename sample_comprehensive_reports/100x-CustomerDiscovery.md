Since frauds, churns and defaults happen less frequently, the datasets for these problems turn out to be naturally highly unbalanced. Consequently, all supervised machine learning classifiers tend to yield substantial false-positive rates when trained on such unbalanced datasets. We propose two ways of data balancing. In the first, we propose an oversampling method to generate synthetic samples of minority class using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We employ Vanilla GAN [1], Wasserstein GAN [2] and CTGAN [3] separately to oversample the minority class samples. In order to assess the efficacy of our proposed approach, we use a host of machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, support vector machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression on the data balanced by GANs. In the second method, we introduce a hybrid method to handle data imbalance. In this second way, we utilize the power of under-sampling and oversampling together by augmenting the synthetic minority class data oversampled by GAN with the undersampled majority class data obtained by one-class support vigor machine (OCSVM) [4]. We combine both over-sampled data generated by GAN and the data under-sampled by OCSVM [4] and pass the resultant data to classifiers. When we compared our results to those of Farquad et al.[5], Sundarkumar, Ravi, and Siddeshwar [6], our proposed methods outperform the previous results in terms of the area under the ROC curve (AUC) on all datasets.\nIntroduction\nCustomer relationship management (CRM) is a process of analyzing and utilizing marketing databases and leveraging communication technologies for analyzing the corporate practices and methods to maximize the lifetime value of all customers [39]. Operationalization of CRM involves solving a host of business problems analytically. Some of the important CRM-related business problem include fraud detection, default prediction, churn prediction, and network intrusion detection. Churn is a scenario where a few of a bank\'s/financial institution\'s/service provider\'s currently loyal customers attrite or depart to competition. The number of banks and financial institutions has risen in the previous 2 decades. Customers shifting their allegiance from one bank to another has become a frequent occurrence. As a result, creating a robust and adaptable system that can anticipate/predict which existing loyal customers may churn out in the near future is very critical to improving the bottom line. Insurance fraud inflicts massive losses on the insurance firms to the tune of billions of dollars. Fraudulent claims are enormously expensive as well as entail reputational loss to insurance companies. Hence, detecting them, whether online or offline, will substantially minimize the loss. But since insurance firms provide relatively little data about fraud, identifying fraud is difficult. Then, loan defaults also cause a major dent to the revenues and operations of a bank. If only, loan defaults or non-performing assets (NPAs) are identified accurately, it will be beneficial to the bank both financial and reputational aspects.\nSince the churn prediction, insurance fraud detection and default prediction datasets are much skewed, by virtue of the nature of the business, the distribution of positive class namely, churn/fraud/default versus the negative class namely, loyal/genuine/ regular classes follows a 90%:10% ratio or greater. This aspect is known as data imbalance in data science parlance. In binary classification, almost all machine learning classifiers underperform on such an unbalanced training set. That means, the algorithms become biased towards majority class such that the minority class samples are incorrectly predicted as the majority class primarily because of the overwhelmingly disproportionate large number of negative class samples vis-à-vis that of the positive class, which is of interest to us. It is hard to create synthetic data which has the same distribution as the original data.\nIn the literature, numerous approaches were proposed to oversample minority class data. The drawback with these strategies is that they repeat the data without understanding the distribution of class labels. Since GANs learn the distributional properties of any data and can generate fake samples, they are a reasonable candidate for generating fake samples from fraud class, churn class and default class. GANs are complex to train and deploy in production because they require a large amount of hyperparameter tweaking and distributed training assistance. We forecast fraud in auto insurance, consumer attrition in credit cards, and loan default customers by first proposing an oversampling of minority classes employing the deep learning architecture GAN [1] to deal with the problem of data imbalance, and then invoke a few machine learning classifiers for classification. Secondly, we propose another hybrid method in which we oversample the minority class samples using GAN and undersample the majority class by extracting the support vectors from majority class samples using one class support vector machine (OCSVM) to form a balanced dataset.\nLiterature Review\nNowadays, generative deep learning models have been widely used for synthetic data generation and after massive success of GAN [1] on image data it has attracted researchers to apply it to generate minority tabular data as well. Gangwar and Ravi [7] employed a variety of methods to oversample the minority class to address the data imbalance issue in the case of credit card fraud detection. They employed a couple of variants of GAN (vanilla GAN and Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) ) on the credit card fraud dataset. They also performed an ablation study using GAN+SMOTE, WGAN+SMOTE, GAN+ADASYN, WGAN+ADASYN, and validated using a couple of machine learning algorithms. The focus of their study is to reduce the false positives. Sisodia et al. [8] analyzed the performance of class balancing approaches for detecting credit card fraud. They used different SMOTE versions and performed undersampling & oversampling and validated their methods using different classifiers. Randhwa et al. [9] employed a diverse range of machine learning classifiers and designed an ensemble using majority voting for credit card fraud detection. Tanaka et al. [10] used GAN for oversampling the minority class data in the medical domain. They concluded that it is effective in the context of sensitive data privacy management. Mottini et al. [11] proposed Cramer GAN for PNR Synthesis of data consisting of categorical and numerical data. Instead of sigmoid they applied softmax to generate categorical variables. Fiore et al. [12] used Vanilla GAN to improve the efficacy of the detection of credit card fraud. Vega-Marquez et al. [13] deployed the conditional GAN to generate synthetic data for both classes. They discovered that the synthetic data improved F1-score with the xgboost classifier.\nChe and Li [14] designed a new GAN named MaliGAN to generate discrete variables. By creating unique functions, they aim to create a differential model. Kusner and Hernández-Lobato [15] used gumbel-softmax distribution to create the discrete element sequence. Ping et al. [16] introduced a web-based data synthesizer using a Bayesian network to model the correlation between features. Various GAN models handling the tabular data have recently appeared in literature. RGAN and RCGAN [17] can generate real-valued time-series data. Camino et. al. [18] used GAN to generate multi-categorical samples. Choi et al. [19] used GAN for generating multi-label discrete patient records which combines an auto-encoder and a GAN to generate heterogeneous non-time-series continuous and/or binary data. This is also known as MedGAN. Patel et al. [20] designed a new GAN called CorGAN which learns the distribution of real patient records using convolutional generative adversarial networks. They demonstrated that CNNs are better than MLPs in extracting correlated features. Park et al. [21] proposed a novel architecture for GAN that employs CNN to produce tabular data to address the problem of generating synthetic data for a tabular dataset. By lowering cross-entropy loss, TableGAN explicitly enhances prediction accuracy on synthetic data. Xu and Veeramachaneni [22] proposed a GAN for generating tabular data which learns the marginal distribution of each column by minimizing the KL divergence. Xu et al. [3] proposed a new GAN for modeling synthetic data using conditional GAN known as CTGAN. CTGAN [3] aims to address the problem of several modes in continuous columns and unbalanced modes in discrete columns, which makes modeling complex.\nRegarding churn prediction, Smith and Gupta [23] used MLP, Hopfield neural network, and self-organizing neural networks to address churn issues. Ferreira et al. [24] used a wireless data form Brazil, was evaluated using a multilayer perceptron, C4.5 decision tree, hierarchical neuro-fuzzy system as well as a data-mining t \nGenerative AI in Fintech Market Growth 2022-2032\n \n  \nMarket.us\nOne Stop Shop For Reports\nPublished Jun 6, 2023\n  Generative AI in Fintech Market will exceed USD 6,256 million by 2032, rising from USD 865 million in 2022.

Artificial Intelligence improves results by applying methods derived from the aspects of human Intelligence but beyond human scale. The computational arms race since the past few years has revolutionized the fintech companies. Further, data and the near-endless amounts of information are transforming AI to unprecedented levels where smart contracts will merely continue the market trend.  In the finance industry, AI is used to examine cash accounts, credit accounts, and investment accounts to look at a person\'s overall financial health, keeping up with real-time changes and then creating customized advice based on new incoming data. AI and machine learning have benefited the banks and fintech as they can process vast amounts of information about customers. This data and information are then compared to obtain results about suitable services/products that customers want, which has aided, primarily, developing customer relations Also, the increasing demand for process automation among financial organizations\u200b is driving the market. Process automation is one of the significant drivers of Artificial Intelligence in financial organizations. However, it is further evolving into cognitive process automation, where AI systems can perform even more complex automation processes.\u200b For instance, in May 2020, Traydstream, a FinTech that scans trade documents with artificial Intelligence (AI), partnered with Infosys Finacle to implement blockchain technology and further automate trade finance. The partnership will allow Finacle\'s blockchain tech, called Finacle TradeConnect, to be integrated with Traydstream\'s platform, which uses AI to scan documents and cut down the time it takes to check on rules or regulations in trade, where mistakes can be costly and time-consuming to correct.\u200b Moreover, credit card companies are implementing predictive analytics into their existing fraud detection workflows to reduce false positives. For instance, in May 2020, SparkCognition, an industrial AI company, announced that the Japanese AI and fintech company, MILIZE Co. Ltd, would offer financial institutions fraud detection and anti-money laundering (AML) solutions. These solutions are built using the automated machine learning software of SparkCognition. As a result, the software detects fraudulent transactions with about 90% accuracy, which is anticipated to lead to a significant improvement in the credit card companies\' profitability AI is further on its way to becoming mainstream in Financial Services within the short term. For instance, according to a survey conducted by Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF) in 2020, 85% of all respondents in the study used some forms of AI, with the fintech companies being slightly ahead of incumbents in the adoption of AI. Owing to these benefits offered by AI technology, fintech companies are increasingly demanding based solutions. Moreover, the fintech industry is witnessing a significant increase in the number of start-ups. These players are also highly attracted to the adoption of Artificial Intelligence to automate and expand their businesses Additionally, as brick and mortar retailers continue to face challenges due to the onset of COVID-19 pandemic, many merchants are implementing point-of-sale financing alternatives as a potential new avenue for growth. Apart from utilizing current data like bank account statements for underwriting, these players are further using AI models to assess consumer behaviors based on their transaction history, product purchase, and other data points to create a sharper customer risk profile.\u200b Also, banks and financial institutions are adopting AI solutions to harness information and insights locked away in unstructured documents and automate the manual process done traditionally by banks in double-quick time.\u200bFor instance, in April 2020, Temenos, the banking software company, announced the launch of eight propositions - using innovative Explainable AI (XAI) and cloud technologies to help banks and financial institutions in their immediate response to the Covid-19 crisis.   Key Market Trends   Quantitative and Asset Management\u200b to Witness Significant Growth   Fintech has been undergoing a continued evolution in the landscape of investment management. Advanced technology and solution adoption, including the use of big data, AI, and machine learning (ML) to help businesses evaluate investment opportunities, optimize their investment portfolios, and mitigate the associated risks have been clinical in the technology adoption.  The investment advisory services, for instance, are undergoing radical changes with the growth and evolution of automated wealth advisers. These advisers can assist the investors without the intervention of a human adviser, and can also be used in combination with a human adviser. It extends the ability to provide tailored, actionable advice to its investors with ease of access, at a partially lower cost.\u200b  In the area of financial record keeping, blockchain, and distributed ledger technology are augmenting the AI adoption by creating new ways to record, track, and store transactions for financial assets. For instance, Sentifi, a Swiss Fintech company established in 2012, uses AI and ML to enable investors and other financial market stakeholders to tap into the online available financial intelligence of millions of persons and organizations.

In the financial domain, relation extraction plays a vital role in extracting valuable information from financial documents, such as news articles, earnings reports, and company filings. This paper describes our solution to relation extraction on one such dataset REFinD. The dataset was released along with shared task as a part of the Fourth Workshop on Knowledge Discovery from Unstructured Data in Financial Services, co-located with SIGIR 2023. In this paper, we employed OpenAI models under the framework of in-context learning (ICL). We utilized two retrieval strategies to find top K relevant incontext learning demonstrations / examples from training data for a given test example. The first retrieval mechanism, we employed, is a learning-free dense retriever and the other system is a learning-based retriever. We were able to achieve 3rd rank overall (model performance and report). Our best F1-score is 0.718.\nFigure 1\n. Relation Extraction example, here both organizations are connected with "acquired by" relation.\nIntroduction\nThe emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 [6] [12] represents a significant advancement in natural language processing (NLP). These models have expertise in variety of domains and hence they can be used as it is in multiple NLP tasks. Traditionaly language models use separate pre-training-and fine-tuning pipelines [1] [3] [5] [4] [9] where fine-tune stage follows pre-training. Models are fine-tuned on a task-specific dataset in a fully-supervised manner. More recently a new paradigm known as in-context learning (ICL) [6] [14] is being used which formulates an NLP task such that LLMs make predictions by learning from demonstrations. These demonstrations are presented to the LLMs in the context prompt itself.\nUnder the framework of ICL, LLMs achieve remarkable performance rivaling previous fully-supervised methods even with only a limited number of demonstrations provided in the prompt in various tasks such as solving math problems, commonsense reasoning, text classification, fact retrieval, natural language inference, and semantic parsing [6] [14] [8]. Recently, ICL based approach [16] is utilized for Relation Extraction (RE) task. RE seeks to identify a semantic relationship between a given entity pair mentioned in a sentence, which is the central task for knowledge retrieval requiring a deep understanding of natural language. The approach achieves improvements over not only existing GPT-3 baselines, but also on fully-supervised baselines. Specifically, it achieves SOTA performances on the Semeval and SciERC datasets, and competitive performances on the TACRED and ACE05 datasets.\nRetrieval of examples to demonstrate is a key factor in the overall performance on these pipelines. LLMs can relate to the presented "to be predicted" data point more In this paper, we employed GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 under the framework of ICL for the relation extraction task on REFinD dataset. We utilized two retrieval strategies to find top K relevant in-context learning demonstrations / examples from training data for a given test example. The first mechanism we have employed is a learning-free dense retriever. The other system we have utilized is a learningbased retriever [13].\n2 Preliminary Background 2.1 Task Definition As per the challenge "Relation Extraction is the task of automatically identifying and classifying the semantic relationships that exist between different entities in a given text." This shared task is a part of "Knowledge Discovery from Unstructured Data in Financial Services" (KDF) workshop which is collocated with SIGIR 2023.\nLet C denote the input context and e1 in C, e2 in C denote the pair of entity pairs. Given a set of predefined relation classes R, relation extraction aims to predict the relation y in R between the pair of entities (e1, e2) within the context C, or if there is no predefined relation between them, predict y="no relation".\nData\nThe dataset [18] released with this task is the largest relation extraction dataset for financial documents to date. Overall REFinD contains around 29K instances and 22 relations among 8 types of entity pairs. REFinD is created using raw text from various 10-X reports (including 10-K, 10-Q, etc. broadly known as 10-X) of publicly traded companies obtained from US Securities and Exchange Commission. Figure-2 shows different entity types and relations exist between them.\nIn Context Learning\nIn-context learning (ICL) refers to one of the core emergent abilities [17] that infers new tasks from context. We use the terms \'in-weights learning\' and \'in-context learning\' from prior work on sequence models [6] to distinguish between gradient-based learning with parameter updates and gradient-free learning from context, respectively. Formally, each training instance is first linearized into an input text x = (x1...xn ) and an output text y = (y1...yn), where for all tokens x1...xn, y1...yn in V and V is the vocabulary set of the LM. Given a new test input text x-test, in-context learning defines the generation of output y as y-test ∼ PLM(y-test | x1,y1,...,xk,yk, x-test), where ∼ refers to decoding strategies (e.g., greedy decoding and nuclear sampling [11]), and each in-context example ei= (xi,yi) is sampled from a training set D. The generation procedure is especially attractive as it eliminates the need for updating the parameters of the language model when encountering a new task, which is often expensive and impractical. Notably, the performance of ICL on downstream tasks can vary from almost random to comparable with state-of-the-art systems, depending on the quality of the retrieved in-context examples [13] [10] [19].\nGPT-FinRE\nGPT-RE is formalized under the ICL framework, using GPT models as shown in Figure-3.\nPrompt Construction\nWe construct a prompt for each given test example,which is fed to the GPT models. Each prompt consists of the following components.\nTask Description and Predefined Classes : We provide a succinct overview of the RE task description and the subset of predefined classes R, denoted by O. This subset is all possible relations exist between entity types of e1 and e2. The model is explicitly asked to output the relation, which belongs to the O. Otherwise, the model will output "no relation". K-shot Demonstrations : In the demonstration part, we reformulate each example by first showing the input prompt x-demo = Prompt(C, e1, e2) and the relation label y-demo.\nTest Input : Similar to the demonstrations, we offer the test input prompt x-test, and GPT models are expected to generate the corresponding relation y-test. Table 1. Our performance on test data with different combinations of retriever and LLM\nRetrieval Systems\nWe have employed two retrieval strategies to find top K relevant in-context learning demonstrations / examples from training data for a given test example.\nKNN with OpenAI Embeddings.\nSince ICL demonstrations closer to the test sample in the embedding space result in more consistent and robust performance [10]. We utilized the KNN to retrieve the most similar examples in the training set as the few-shot demonstrations for each test example. As this learning-free dense retriever relies on the choice of the embedding space, we used OpenAI embeddings (text-embedding-ada-002) to obtain example representations. For similarity search, we used FAISS tool [2].\nEPR (Efficient Prompt Retrieval)\n. This learningbased dense retriever is trained to retrieve a better singleton in-context example [13] , and Top-K most similar examples are selected in the inference stage. This method for retrieving prompts for in-context learning uses annotated data and a LM. Given an input-output pair, it estimates the probability of the output given the input and a candidate training example as the prompt, and labels training examples as positive or negative based on this probability. It then trains an efficient dense retriever from this data, which is used to retrieve training examples as prompts at test time. Due to limited access to OpenAI, we have used the gpt-neo-2.7B model [7] as our choice of LM.\nRandom Class Examples. Along with KNN / EPR\nbased examples, we also added K examples randomly for each possible class between two entity types to add more variety in the final prompt.\nExperiments\nDue to limited access and cost associated with OpenAI, We performed 4 primary experiments on the test dataset. We tried various rule based heuristics to improve the F1-score, but it didn\'t work as expected. We used retriever implementations from 1 .\n1 https://github.com/HKUNLP/icl-ceil\nResults\nThe results are shown in Table-1. Our best F1-Score is 0.718. We got 4th position in the shared-task. We find that GPT 4 performs better than GPT 3.5 Turbo. We also find that learning based retriever (EPR) outperforms learning-free retriever (KNN with OpenAI embeddigs).\nFuture Work\nIn future we want to utilize GPT 4 for EPR. We also want to use different retrieval approaches such as Compositional Exemplars for In-context Learning (CEIL) [15].\nConclusion\nThis work explores the potential of GPT + ICL on Financial Relation Extraction (REFinD dataset). We used two retrieval mechanisms to find similar examples: (1) KNN with OpenAI Embeddings (2) EPR. We tried two different GPT models: (1) GPT 3.5 Turbo and GPT 4.

A world where they can make the right offer at the right time for the right person—in a communication that feels like a cohesive whole, rather than like some disjointed Mad Libs concoction. A world where efficiency gains from automation and automated-content generation go hand in hand with increased customer insights. A world where customers save time and effort finding and accessing the goods and services they want and need. A world where marketers can better meet and deliver customer value and focus on innovation.\nGenerative AI (gen AI) brings this holy grail of hyperpersonalization at scale close to reality.\nGen AI is making it possible to revolutionize consumer marketing as we currently know it. At an individual-company level, marketing campaigns that once required months of content design, insight generation, and customer targeting can be rolled out in weeks or even days, often with at-scale personalization and automated testing. Website development and customer service tasks are too often the bottlenecks in interactions with individual consumers. But when executed well, they can induce greater engagement and improve satisfaction. Marketers can simultaneously analyze and interpret text, image, and video data to better understand innovation opportunities. Gen AI is powering granular personalization in ways that just weren’t possible before.\nThese productivity gains from gen AI are beginning to ripple across the global economic marketplace. A recent McKinsey report estimates that gen AI could contribute up to $4.4 trillion in annual global productivity. According to the analysis, marketing and sales is one of four functional groups that combined could reap an estimated 75 percent of that value.  1          The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier,” McKinsey, June 14, 2023. The productivity of marketing alone due to gen AI could increase between 5 and 15 percent of total marketing spend, worth about $463 billion annually.\nChange is coming, and companies that sit on the sidelines risk being left behind.\nIn this article, we explore three ways consumer companies can create value with gen AI (exhibit). Companies are already wading into this new world by exploiting existing gen AI models that are publicly available. The next step for them will be to differentiate themselves, propelling unequaled customization and greater capabilities by integrating those models with their own data and systems. Finally, we look at the long-term opportunities for companies that want to push even further by reinventing their end-to-end processes with gen AI.\n \nGetting started with gen AI in marketing\nCurrent uses of gen AI in marketing mostly consist of off-the-shelf pilots integrated into existing workflows. These efforts are delivering immediate value by helping companies generate copy and images in less time, personalize campaigns, and respond to and learn from customer feedback. But they are also helping companies learn about gen AI, build the capabilities they’ll need to take advantage of it in deeper ways, and free up valuable employees for higher-level tasks. That’s one of the attractions of gen AI: as the following examples show, it has the potential to deliver value quickly, unlike other technologies that reward companies only after years of investment.\n Personalization of marketing campaigns. Crafts retailer Michaels Stores, for example, is using gen AI as part of its approach to deepen customer engagement through more personalized and frequent interactions with its shoppers. The company built a content generation and decision-making platform to help with copy development and to better understand how customer segments engage with different messages. Michaels has gone from personalizing 20 percent of its email campaigns to personalizing 95 percent. This has lifted the click-through rate for SMS campaigns by 41 percent and email campaigns by 25 percent.  2           \n Unstructured customer data analysis. Hyperpersonalization efforts also benefit from more granular analyses of consumer behavior, which can be augmented by gen AI. Personal-clothing service Stitch Fix, for example, uses gen AI to help stylists interpret customer feedback and provide product recommendations. Instacart is using gen AI to offer customers recipes and meal-planning ideas and to generate shopping lists.\n Process automation. Marketers have always played a core integrating role across enterprises. Unsurprisingly, we are seeing opportunities for companies to automate interactions between marketing and other functions (for example, service, sales, product development, R&amp;D, and legal reviews). One direct-to-consumer retailer, for instance, is using gen AI to help resolve customer tickets, such as order-taking or repair requests. By using gen AI to automate process steps (for example, retrieving information at the back end, making necessary changes, and replying to customers in the brand’s voice), the company has seen a more than 80 percent decrease in time to first response and a four-minute reduction in average time to resolve a ticket. The use of gen AI has also given the company’s customer support team more time to focus on higher-level customer interactions. In addition, there are significant opportunities to streamline the creation of multiversion, long-lead-time marketing assets, such as media plans, quarterly reviews, strategic plans, and meeting agendas.\n Opportunity identification and idea generation. Marketers are using gen AI to analyze competitor moves, assess consumer sentiment, and test new product opportunities. Rapid generation of response-ready product concepts can improve the efficiency of successful products, increase testing accuracy, and accelerate time to market. Mattel, for instance, is using AI in Hot Wheels product development to generate four times as many product concept images as before, inspiring new features and designs. Kellogg’s is scanning trending recipes that incorporate (or could incorporate) breakfast cereal and using the resulting data to launch social campaigns around creative and relevant recipes. And L’Oréal is analyzing millions of online comments, images, and videos to identify potential product innovation opportunities.\nAs companies start exploring opportunities with gen AI, they will want to ensure that whatever efforts they launch are in keeping with their overall marketing goals. Attempting to incorporate too many different gen AI initiatives in the hope that something sticks can end up being costly, diffuse, and difficult to track, making it hard to incorporate whatever lessons are generated across the launches. Instead, companies can focus on two or three use cases wherein off-the-shelf gen AI tools can provide immediate impact in priority domains.\nThroughout the process of applying and adopting gen AI, marketers need to ensure that measures are in place to mitigate risks such as “hallucinations” (when gen AI produces confident-sounding outputs that are not grounded in verifiable facts, data, or algorithmic patterns), biases, data privacy violations, and copyright infringement. Gen AI is typically not well suited for high-stakes decision making, regulated environments, or applications that involve a heavy volume of requests or numerical reasoning. We’ve found that establishing an accountable leader, as well as a technology oversight board, are important first steps. Other guardrails may include working in a level of human review for anything going directly to a customer or limiting the kinds of topics that gen AI can address for marketing campaigns.\n \nCustomized gen AI for marketing\nLots of companies have started developing use cases like the ones listed above. However, companies seeking to truly differentiate themselves are going further. They are creating unique, customized solutions for customers by adapting off-the-shelf models that are trained on smaller, task-specific data sets. This is when companies can start to see exponential improvements in customizing everything for customers from campaigns to products. When companies start reshaping existing gen AI models with their own data and for their own highly specific needs, the results can be profound.\nIn the world of marketing, fine-tuning an existing gen AI model might mean training an open-source model with proprietary data (for example, brand guidelines or historical-marketing-campaign creatives) to generate bespoke content. This kind of semicustom gen AI solution can be regularly updated with new company data and ongoing learning. The result is a continually improving, bespoke gen AI solution that helps increase a company’s competitive advantage as it develops.\nWe are already seeing companies experiment with gen AI in high-priority use cases. Here are two examples:\nHyperlocal outreach\nOne European telecommunications company used gen AI to shift from highly manual, blunt customer outreach messaging to messaging that would more effectively engage with specific segments. Previously, this telco deployed messages to just four mac \nVenus Kaur\nJournal of Computer Science Research\nSchool of Information Technology, Vivekananda Institute of Professional Studies\nARTICLE INFO ABSTRACT\nSchool of Information Technology, Vivekananda Institute of Professional Studies\nDelhi, DelhiIndia, India\nVasvi Khullar\nJournal of Computer Science Research\nSchool of Information Technology, Vivekananda Institute of Professional Studies\nARTICLE INFO ABSTRACT\nSchool of Information Technology, Vivekananda Institute of Professional Studies\nDelhi, DelhiIndia, India\nNeha Verma neha.verma@vips.edu\nJournal of Computer Science Research\nSchool of Information Technology, Vivekananda Institute of Professional Studies\nARTICLE INFO ABSTRACT\nSchool of Information Technology, Vivekananda Institute of Professional Studies\nDelhi, DelhiIndia, India\nNeha Verma\nJournal of Computer Science Research\nSchool of Information Technology, Vivekananda Institute of Professional Studies\nARTICLE INFO ABSTRACT\nSchool of Information Technology, Vivekananda Institute of Professional Studies\nDelhi, DelhiIndia, India\nReview of Artificial Intelligence with Retailing Sector\nJournal of Computer Science Research |\n02January 202010.30564/jcsr.v2i1.1591Article history Received: 21 December 2019 Accepted: 20 January 2020 Published Online: 31 March 20201 Distributed under creative commons license 4.0 REVIEW Big data Retail Internet of Things (IoT) *Corresponding Author:Artificial Intelligence(AI)\nThis research service provides an original perspective on how artificial intelligence (AI) is making its way into the retail sector.

Those days are gone when retailer can sell what they want to sell. Now, Retailers to have compete in every sector of excellence beyond price. Convenience and experience to consumer are becoming the two most crucial factor (Offline and online) of battleground for brands. As per a survey done the Store WPP in partnership with IBM on customers and retailers, its results that 48% should provide personalized promotion when they demand it online, also 45% of them wants similar online product availabilities as in-store. AI offers retailers the opportunity to both radically enhance and personalise the customer experience and to realise significant gains in productivity throughout the business -from the warehouse, to delivery, to head office and online and physical outlets. In a highly competitive market, retailers cannot afford to be left behind.\nHowever, launching and progressing AI within a business does not come without its challenges: getting buy in from senior management (who often do not have a tech or data background), choosing the right partners and finding staff with the appropriate skill sets can all present significant hurdles. Another surprising fact came in front like retailers who are familiar with AI and wants to invest in it are 94% but ironically 91% of retailer also believes that it could be disruptive for their organization [3] . On the other hand, customer want everything their own way: the way the shop, what they want to explore, customization and personalization, time they want to shop and they way want to get their products they want everything in their control. which leads to need for change in retailing and where Artificial Intelligence comes to fore [4] .\nThe best applications of AI work alongside other technologies and alongside people within retail businesses. That means seeing the deployment of AI not just as the development of isolated technology, but part of a wider process of change. That in turn implies that the UK needs to develop a talent pool for AI with a wide spectrum of skills.AI help the brands and retailer to understand the DOI: https://doi.org/10.30564/jcsr.v2i1.1591 consumer in different manner with the helps of smart devices which collects data, browsing cookies, facial expressions, euphemisms, preferences, living style etc. which can be synthesized to provide better recommendation to make fast and better decisions [13] .\nLiterature Review\nTo review topic of Artificial intelligence in retailing a set of articles were searched from Scopus. The search terms were "Retail" and "Artificial intelligence" with in topic search terms were "Big Data" and "IoT". "Computer science", "Business management and security" and "Engineering" were the subject area for Research. This resulted in 54 documents from which 20 were not citied. After researching of 34 documents 20 were not found in the Scopus database and rest 14 were chosen for comprehensive review.\nBasically, the distinctive and numerous quantities of procedures are led to explore the proficient vitality. The board preparing for the impact of artificial intelligence in retailing which essentially lies in three explicit systems which are suggested as quantitative, qualitative and mixed method. Following that, these techniques have given a way to deal with experience a describe about few strategies that are utilized for proficiency, unwavering quality and operability of new techniques and gadgets in the era of retails. Subsequently, I have discovered a few relevant articles to comprehend the administration strength of artificial intelligence in retailing which have used techniques, for example, an interpretivist approach, case studies, mixed method approach and; Elastic net approach and sentiment analysis [15] .\nReview On Sentiment Analysis\nIn this analysis done by Y. Li and H. Fleyeh [17] information are gathered from Twitter, a small scale blogging stage, which has been generally utilized for investigation of notion ("positive", "negative" or "nonpartisan"). The slithered twitter information are those tweets incorporate "IKEA" in explored urban communities amid entry period of individual IKEA. Dialects explored in this work are English and Swedish. English-based tweets are best in class in Sentiment examination, while there is not very many investigations in the Swedish-based supposition examination. For further investigation author introduced elastic net approach method to investigate the public opinions. So as to explore general conclusions about recently opened IKEA store, neighbourhood inhabitancies\' tweets containing "IKEA" are crawled (to be specific "IKEA dataset"). At that point the notion to discover vi- sual tweets are figured for profound comprehension of their assessment. The system of Sentiment analysis to manage English and Swedish tweets is appeared in Figure 1. For English tweets, vocabulary-based methodologies is utilized thus in perspective on its capacity and validity in numerous present applications. But here author describe the limitation of sentiment analysis as the absence sentiment lexicon in Swedish dictionary which confine the research to some extent and its notion can be only anticipated by AI based strategies.

Organizations are trying their best to match up with this evolution so that they are ready to face the competition in the market. Artificial Intelligence is the name of one such technology which is getting attention across the world because of its many advantages. Organized retail stores are one of the first sectors to successfully implement this technology in order to meet the demands of the customers. This technology also plays a crucial role in gathering the data as well as analyzing it. The results are useful for the development of new marketing strategies which might be adopted by the company in the future. This study aims to identify the factors which have a direct impact on the development of marketing strategies by the use of Artificial Intelligence. The study is limited to West Bengal, India. The target population was the employees who work in the retail outlets. Reliability as well as validity study along with Multiple Regression Analysis was implemented in this study. Some crucial factors were identified which were helpful in the designing of the effective and efficient marketing strategies of the retail sector firms through the extensive use of Artificial Intelligence.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThere has been a new paradigm shift in technology. Technology is rapidly evolving and one of the most sought after topics in today\'s world is Artificial Intelligence. It has become an enigma in the market and organizations are looking for various ways to implement this piece of technology into their system. On a basic level, the term "intelligence" refers to the mental capabilities of an individual which is related to analysis, planning, problem solving and many more. Artificial Intelligence is regarded as a special branch in computer science. It deals with enabling the computer systems perform various tasks which are very similar to that of human intelligence processes such as deduction, learning and decision making. Artificial Intelligence also mechanizes the intelligent behavior of the humans. Advanced data systems, algorithms as well as a software language constitute an Artificial Intelligence system.\nArtificial Intelligence is used by many organizations especially in marketing. Marketing strategies could be developed by the analysis of various parameters such as the client\'s needs, the collection of products, accessibility to the clients, etc.\nThere are various types of marketing strategies such as cost leadership strategies, differentiation strategies, focus strategies, alliance strategies, diversification strategies, direct marketing strategies, etc. They are utilized for demand forecasting, advertisement, gauging the extent of customer satisfaction, analysis of the various macroeconomic and micro-economic factors, etc. Some of the examples of Artificial Intelligence used for advertisements in companies are Asko, Pinterest, Zendesk, Asos, Kellogg, Staples, Amazon, Tumi, Wordsmith, Autodesk, etc. Studies reveal that in India today, only 20 per cent of the organizations have successfully implemented Artificial Intelligence systems (Bughin, McCarthy & Chui, 2017) 5 . It is very much important for the management to recognize the kind of Artificial Intelligence which would be best suited to their organizational system as the technology used is very sophisticated. There is a huge growth of the retail sector in India, especially the organized retail outlets. Big Bazar, Pantaloons, Reliance, etc, are some of the big names in this sector. These outlets receive thousands of customers daily in their centre and it would be highly beneficial for them if they would be able to jot down the details of these customers so that the marketing team can effectively tap into their system. This paper delves into the organized retail sector of West Bengal and tries to analyze the factors which have an impact on developing the marketing strategies with the help from Artificial Intelligence.\nII. LITERATURE REVIEW\nThe customers of this generation are tech savvy. With the use of technology, they can generate an idea about the product features and its details within a matter of a few seconds. Hence, it is essential for the companies to understand the expectations of the customers to whom they are catering to. Artificial Intelligence can help the organizations to garner a better understanding regarding the expectations of the customers. With this, from the customer\'s point of view, the products that they are seeking might be easily available to them thus, ensuring marketing efficiency. Also, it will immensely help them to shop in a hassle free manner resulting in frictionless shopping experience. This would result in both customer loyalty as well as building customer satisfaction (Riter, 2017) 6 . There is an existence of a positive correlation between that of implementation of Artificial Intelligence with that of the rendering of effective and quality decision making (Saleh & Abdullah, 2009) 4 . It is highly imperative for the managers to use the tools and methods of Artificial Intelligence while rendering decisions as multiple factors needs to be considered in order to come to a definite conclusion. Also, the administrative officers need to be emotionally resilient in order for them to come to correct decisions. Hence, Artificial Intelligence solves this error as human intelligence could be applied while making a decision without bringing in the complexities of the human emotions which might increase the chances of making a mistake. Thus, the quality of the decision making would be higher in case an Artificial Intelligence is used as compared to other traditional methods like resorting to the advice of experts in that particular domain. However, it must be kept in mind that time is crucial and often times, the decision needs to be made fast. In times like these, Artificial Intelligence can be used as a tool to make decisions which could help in boosting the profitability of the organizations. Artificial Intelligence is very much helpful in the detection of the patterns of the data generated by the user content deployed by the firms. The organizations define the problem for which they want to gather data and the data analysis is also chalked out well in advance. This data is collected and subsequently analyzed by Artificial Intelligence in order to forecast the behavior of the users in the near future. Thus, the problem is quickly solved in a matter of moments by Artificial Intelligence (Sukhraj, 2017) 7 and it comes up with various alternative situations which can be implemented by the firm. Artificial Intelligence can also go through the user\'s comments about their products and as a result, they can analyze their personality characteristics which could further provide intel on the "best" customers. Artificial Intelligence can gather information and analyze it in order to generate various promotional ideas which are effective. It can help a firm to draw a conclusion to important decisions like whether targeted ads are the need of the hour or nontargeted ads will do (Arslan & Telang, 2015) 8 . However, targeted advertisements should not destroy the privacy of the consumers as this can backfire on the company (Lancefield, Ambler, Rauber & Patel, 2011) 9 . Thus, Artificial Intelligence could help in the creation of a better user experience through the help of personalization and also barring the invasion of privacy of the consumers. This could be done with the help of Artificial Intelligence. Post Purchase services are a vital part of the service industry as it reinforces the customer satisfaction regarding a particular product. This might also result in generating word of mouth advertisements which would further help the organizations (Kietzmann & Canhoto, 2013) 10 . Artificial Intelligence could help in identifying the customers who needs the post purchase services and help the organization in doing the follow up as well. Organizations today need to plan their marketing strategies in order to meet their product demand on a daily basis. The higher management is in charge of the development of these strategies to place their company in a good position in the future (Idris, et al., 2006) 1 . Planning the marketing strategies is not completed until and unless they are executed properly. Proper execution of these strategies results from the further growth and development of the firms which can be assisted with by Artificial Intelligence ( proves Sampling Adequacy of dataset which supports the execution of EFA (Table: 2). We can easily segregate 6 factors with \'factor loadings\' greater than 0.5 by the help of Principal Component Analysis and Varimax with Kaiser Normalization. On the other hand, \'Variance Inflation Factor\' (VIF) values have been checked and found that all independent factors are Multi-co-linearity error-free because VIF values were less than 3 (Table: 3).\nVI. TESTING OF HYPOTHESIS AND FINDINGS H1: \'Better Understanding Regarding Customer Expectations\' through \'Artificial Intelligence\' positively influences \'Development of Effective Marketing\nStrategies\' in Organized Retail Sector. Significant P-value ( \nArijit Biswas\nSubhajit Sanyal\nAbstract\nE-commerce companies such as Amazon, Alibaba and Flipkart process billions of orders every year. However, these orders represent only a small fraction of all plausible orders. Exploring the space of all plausible orders could help us better understand the relationships between the various entities in an e-commerce ecosystem, namely the customers and the products they purchase. In this paper, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for orders made in e-commerce websites. Once trained, the generator in the GAN could generate any number of plausible orders. Our contributions include: (a) creating a dense and low-dimensional representation of e-commerce orders, (b) train an ecommerceGAN (ecGAN) with real orders to show the feasibility of the proposed paradigm, and (c) train an ecommerce-conditional-GAN (ec 2 GAN) to generate the plausible orders involving a particular product. We propose several qualitative methods to evaluate ecGAN and demonstrate its effectiveness. The ec 2 GAN is used for various kinds of characterization of possible orders involving a product that has just been introduced into the e-commerce system. The proposed approach ec 2 GAN performs significantly better than the baseline in most of the scenarios.\n1 INTRODUCTION\nMajor e-commerce companies such as Amazon, Alibaba, Flipkart and eBay have billions of products in their inventories. However, the space of products is of much lower dimension as there is an inherent underlying structure imposed by product categories, subcategories, price ranges, brands, manufacturers, etc. Similarly on the customer side, though there are several hundreds of millions of customers, they reside in a lower dimensional space as customers can be grouped together based on similarity of purchase behaviors, price/brand sensitivity, ethnicity, etc. Thus the space of e-commerce orders is an interaction of samples from these two spaces where certain interactions are plausible while others are unlikely to happen ever. For example, it is unlikely for a user, who "belongs" to a group of users who are jazz aficionados, to purchase a heavy metal album. On the other hand, if a new tool-kit is introduced in the market, the users who are likely to be the first ones to buy it are the ones who belong to the "Do it Yourself (DIY)" group of users. However, the real orders, i.e., the orders which have been placed in an e-commerce website represent only a tiny fraction of all plausible orders. Exploring the space of all plausible orders could provide important insights into product demands, customer preferences, price estimation, seasonal variations etc., which, if taken into consideration, could directly or indirectly impact revenue and customer satisfaction.\nIn this paper, we propose an approach to learn the distribution of plausible orders using a Generative Adversarial Network [6] . Generative adversarial network (GAN) is a variation of deep neural network that learns a generative model given a set of real data points. The network constitutes of two components: a generator and a discriminator. The generator takes a random noise vector as input and tries to generate samples which are similar to the real data points. Whereas, the discriminator tries to differentiate between the generated fake data points and the real data points. The generator and the discriminator compete with each other and while doing that the generator ends up learning the real data distribution. In our case, the generator learns to generate many novel yet plausible orders which were never ordered in the e-commerce website. This paper makes three major contributions:\n• Order Representation: It is important to learn dense, low dimensional and semantically meaningful representations of orders for using them in a generative network such as GAN. We represent each order as a tuple of {customer, product, price, date}. Each component in the tuple is represented as a dense and lowdimensional vector and they are concatenated to represent an order. This is described in details in Section 3.3.\n• ecommerceGAN (ecGAN):\nIn this version, we use a Wasserstein GAN [1] (Section 3.2) to train a generator which can generate plausible e-commerce orders. We train the ecGAN to explore the overall viability of the proposed approach. More details on this is provided in Section 3.4.\n• ecommerce-conditional-GAN (ec 2 GAN): In this version, we propose a conditional GAN to generate orders which are conditioned on a particular product, i.e., its representation. In the e-commerce space, it is desirable to understand the characteristics of future orders involving a particular product, especially when a new product is launched. As an example, being able to estimate the demographics of the potential customer-base for a new product can help companies make more informed decisions about their marketing efforts. If we can predict the gender, age, tenure, location, and purchase volumes of possible customers accurately, they can be targeted with personalized deals and recommendations. In a similar vein, better estimates of demand and sales can bolster inventory and supply chain decisions. We propose a variation of Wasserstein GAN, called as ecommerce-conditional-GAN or ec 2 GAN, where the generator takes a product representation as input (along with random noise vectors) and generates many plausible orders involving this particular product. We add an additional component to the generator loss, which essentially reconstructs the input product representation. More details on this is provided in Section 3.5.\nEvaluation of GANs is difficult [8, 17, 20] , especially when applied to non-visual domains. We propose to use three different methods to qualitatively evaluate the learned generator in ecGAN: t-SNE [18] , data distribution in the leaves of random forests, and feature correlation. We demonstrate that it is possible to effectively learn the distribution of e-commerce orders. We evaluate ec 2 GAN quantitatively and demonstrate that this could be used to effectively characterize customers, prices and seasonal demands, when a new product is launched in an e-commerce website. We compare the proposed ec 2 GAN with a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (C-VAE) [19] based order generation approach, and show that ec 2 GAN outperforms the baseline in seven out of the nine applied use-cases (maximum absolute improvement is ∼ 22%).\n2 RELATED WORK\nGenerative Adversarial Networks [6] have gained significant popularity in the machine learning community recently as it provides a novel and easy way to learn generative models. It has shown encouraging results in application domains such as computer vision and natural language processing. In [15] , the authors propose deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGAN), which have certain architectural constraints and are effective for unsupervised learning. They show that the deep convolutional adversarial pair learns a hierarchy of representations from object parts to scenes in both the generator and the discriminator. The authors in [4] use a cascade of convolutional networks within a Laplacian pyramid framework to generate images in a coarse-to-fine fashion. In [22] , the authors propose an adversarial network which can learn image-to-image translation without using any paired data. Professor forcing [10] applied GANs along with RNNs as generative units to model sequential data which are prevalent in the speech and NLP domain. Recently GANs have also been used in the context of topic modeling [5] . The proposed model is based on the Energy-Based GANs [21] , but uses a Denoising Autoencoder as the discriminator network.\nThere are several prior works on improving the training, interpretability of noise, and optimization in GANs. InfoGAN [3] is an information-theoretic extension to the GANs that is able to learn disentangled representations in an unsupervised manner. In [16] , the authors present various architectural features and training procedures which can be applied to improve the training of GANs. GANs are known to be unstable, difficult to train and plagued with the problem of mode-collapse 1 . Recently proposed Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) [2] improves stability issues and mitigates the problem of mode-collapse to some extent. To capture the distance between the actual and generated distribution, it uses Earth-Movers distance as a metric as opposed to the conventional Jensen-Shannon divergence. The authors use ideas from reinforcement learning, measure theory and adopt a novel discriminator loss, which is referred to as critic loss in the paper. The results are comparable to the stateof-the-art, with fewer hyper-parameters and stronger theoretical guarantees. A follow up work [7] which comes as an improvement over Wasserstein GANs alleviates the problem of hyper-parameter tuning even further, keeping the stability intact. Gradient penalty is used along with WGAN to remove instability in some settings, which are typically introduced due to critic weight clipping in WGAN.\nTo the best of authors\' knowledge there is no prior work that applied GANs in the e-commerce domain. This is the first work that learns a generator for plausible e-commerce orders and demonstrates applications on product-conditioned order characterization. We also propose several novel quantitative and qualitative ways to evaluate GANs, which would be applicable to many other domains as well.\n3 PROPOSED APPROACH\nIn this section, we describe the details of the proposed approaches: ecGAN and ec 2 GAN. In Section 3.1 and 3.2, we describe the traditional GAN and WGAN respectively. In Section 3.3, we describe the proposed method, which represents e-commerce orders using dense and low-dimensional vectors. In Section 3.4 and 3.5, the details of the proposed GAN variations are provided.\n3.1 Generative Adversarial Network\nGenerative adversarial networks (GAN) [6] are a variation of deep \nAI in Retail Market Size\n AI in Retail Market size valued at USD 6 billion in 2022 and is slated to witness over 30% CAGR from 2023 to 2032. Driven by the extensive use of product identification and computer vision technologies in retail warehouses.\n   \nArtificial intelligence (AI) has wide-ranging applications and has become a future tool for advancement. Healthcare, automotive, manufacturing, and several other booming industries are increasingly integrating AI technologies for everyday tasks. The increased inclination of Gen Z toward online shopping trends in the new era of advanced businesses is accelerating the use of AI in the retail market. The expanding Gen Z population has created the most technology-savvy and mobile-friendly consumer base. Their strong preference to shop online is set to encourage traditional retailers to adopt AI solutions and services.\n Furthermore, cashier-less checkouts are another major benefit of integrating AI in the retail sector that is fueling the industry growth. Using  computer vision  and big data analytics, retailers are transforming routine shopping into intelligent shopping. For instance, in February 2022, Amazon rolled out its Just Walk Out cashier-less technology at its new Amazon Fresh grocery store in Ventura County, California, to offer customers a fully autonomous checkout option.\n  Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Retail Market Report Attributes  \n  \nReport Attribute\nDetails\n Base Year: 2022   Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Retail Market Size in 2022: USD 6 billion    Forecast Period: 2023 to 2032   Forecast Period 2023 to 2032 CAGR: 30%   2032 Value Projection: USD 100 billion    Historical Data for: 2018 to 2022   No. of Pages: 280   Tables, Charts &amp; Figures: 392   Segments covered: Component, Technology, Application, and Region   Growth Drivers:  Growing investments in AI Increasingly empowered consumer Rising disruptive technologies Advent of new business models Advancement in data science    Pitfalls &amp; Challenges:  Limited public-private partnership to address social implications directly Privacy issues associated with the use of AI Growth potential analysis       \nComplex organizational structures may restrain industry progression\nThe organizational framework of retailers is a major factor restraining the AI in retail market growth. Administrative culture can hinder the adoption of AI in businesses, especially in companies with underdeveloped analytical decision-making and digital transformation processes that create suspicion in algorithmic decision-making, fueled by the perception that studies and recommendations are unclear. As per KPMG’s Living in an AI World 2020 report, 62 percent of retail participants were not supportive of AI adoption due to a loss of job security. Nevertheless, artificial intelligence offers the potential to help individuals with tedious, time-consuming tasks, which is speculated to prompt retailers to adopt AI services.\nAI in Retail Market Analysis\n \nAccording to the report, the computer vision technology segment held more than a 15% share of the AI in retail market in 2022. The prevalent utilization of computer vision technology by merchants for several in-store applications to compete with their online rivals is driving the market demand. For instance, in September 2022, Kroger Co., an American retailer, rolled out its visual AI-based  self-checkout solution  that uses Nvidia’s computer vision and AI capabilities with Evergreen’s Visual AI.\nWith respect to components, the solution segment is expected to grow at 30% CAGR through 2032. The widespread adoption of  analytics solutions by online retailers  to widen their client base and offer better customer experience is set to facilitate the industry expansion. For instance, in October 2022, Wayfair, a store-commerce firm, completed a full digital transformation by migrating its data center applications and services to Google Cloud Foundation.\nIn terms of application, the programmatic advertising segment is projected to cross USD 25 billion by 2032. Today\'s omnichannel consumers can be more effectively reached through programmatic advertising that delivers continually tailored messaging at a massive scale, which is foreseen to propel segment development. According to the Journal of Service Management, consumer preference for programmatic advertising is directly related to their attitude toward the retailer and perceived ad relevance, which generates real-time ads that match their interests.\nUnder solution, the AI in retail market size from the price optimization segment is poised to amass substantial gains by 2032, as firms are becoming increasingly competitive to extend their customer reach due to declining product differentiation resulting from the rising use of e-commerce platforms. Moreover, with the e-commerce boom, firms are leveraging AI to determine optimal prices in order to bolster their sales, which is foreseen to drive price optimization solutions uptake.\n \nRegionally, the Europe Artificial Intelligence in retail market is estimated to hold more than 15% revenue share by 2032, attributed to rapid digitalization, shifting customer preferences, and product innovation efforts by industry participants operating in the region. For instance, French retail behemoth Carrefour unveiled its first AI-powered store in Paris – the Flash 10/10 (10 seconds to shop &amp; 10 seconds to pay).\nAI in Retail Market Share\nSome of the leading companies involved in the AI in retail market include\nOracle Corporation\nAmazon Web Services (AWS)\nBloomReach Inc.\nIBM Corporation\nIntel Corporation\nInteractions LLC\nMicrosoft Corporation\nNvidia Corporation\nRetailNext Inc.\nNext IT Corp.\nInbenta Technologies\nSalesforce.com Inc.\nLexalytics Inc.\nSAP SE\nSentient Technologies\nGoogle Inc.\nCognitiveScale Inc.\nVisenze\nBaidu Inc.\nSymbotic\nThese companies majorly engage in product innovation and collaborate with retail firms to remain ahead in the competitive landscape.\nFor instance, in May 2022, Symbotic, a robotics warehouse automation company, announced the deployment of its automation technology at Walmart’s 42 Regional Distribution Centers to improve the accuracy of the retail giant’s inventory and expand the capacity of its warehouses.\nImpact of COVID-19 pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a favorable impact on the growth of artificial intelligence in the retail sector. According to IBM, a technology corporation, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic pushed many in-store retailers to adopt e-commerce solutions, such as the Salesforce commerce cloud solution, which aids merchants in achieving unified customer experience, omnichannel strategies, and automated market analytics. This enables no-contact pickup services, reservation systems in online stores, delivery of meals, and the development of autonomous online businesses, which has positively influenced the market revenue.\nThis Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Retail Market research report includes in-depth coverage of the industry with estimates &amp; forecasts in terms of revenue in USD from 2018 to 2032 for the following segments:  Click here to Buy Section of this Report  \n Market, By  Component \nSolution\nChatbots\nCustomer Behavior Tracking\nCRM\nInventory Management\nPrice Optimization\nRecommendation Engines\nSupply Chain Management\nVisual Search &amp; Visual Listen\nOthers\nServices\nProfessional services\nManaged services\n Market, By Technology \nMachine Learning\nNatural Language Processing (NLP)\nComputer Vision\nOthers\n Market, By Application  \nAutomated Merchandising\nProgrammatic Advertising\nMarket Forecasting\nIn Store AI &amp; Location Optimization\nData Science\nOthers\n The above information has been provided for the following regions and countries:\n North America\nU.S.\nCanada\n Europe\nUK\nGermany\nFrance\nSpain\nSweden\nSwitzerland\n Asia Pacific\nChina\nIndia\nJapan\nSouth Korea\nAustralia\nSingapore\n Latin America \nBrazil\nMexico\n MEA\nUAE\nIsrael\nSouth Africa \nRansome Epie Bawack\n· Samuel\nFosso Wamba\nKevin Daniel\nAndré Carillo\nShahriar Akter\nArtificial intelligence in E-Commerce: a bibliometric study and literature review\n13012345678910.1007/s12525-022-00537-zReceived: 11 September 2021 / Accepted: 22 February 2022RESEARCH PAPERArtificial intelligence · e-commerce · Literature review · Bibliometrics JEL classification O3\nThis paper synthesises research on artificial intelligence (AI) in e-commerce and proposes guidelines on how information systems (IS) research could contribute to this research stream. To this end, the innovative approach of combining bibliometric analysis with an extensive literature review was used. Bibliometric data from 4335 documents were analysed, and 229 articles published in leading IS journals were reviewed. The bibliometric analysis revealed that research on AI in e-commerce focuses primarily on recommender systems. Sentiment analysis, trust, personalisation, and optimisation were identified as the core research themes. It also places Chinabased institutions as leaders in this researcher area. Also, most research papers on AI in e-commerce were published in computer science, AI, business, and management outlets. The literature review reveals the main research topics, styles and themes that have been of interest to IS scholars. Proposals for future research are made based on these findings. This paper presents the first study that attempts to synthesise research on AI in e-commerce. For researchers, it contributes ideas to the way forward in this research area. To practitioners, it provides an organised source of information on how AI can support their e-commerce endeavours.An extensive review and classification of IS literature on AI in e-commerce complemented the bibliometric analysis. It provides more details on how research in this area is conducted in the IS discipline. The review was delimited to the most impactful and influential management information systems (MIS) journals identified during the bibliometric analysis and completed by other well-established MIS journals known for their contributions to e-commerce research(Ngai & Wat, 2002;Wareham et al., 2005). Thus, 20 journals were selected for this review: Decision sciences, Decision support systems, Electronic commerce research and applications, Electronic markets, E-service journal, European journal of information systems, Information and management, Information sciences, Information systems research, International journal of electronic commerce, International journal of information management, Journal of information systems, Journal of information technology, Journal of management information systems, Journal of organisational computing and electronic commerce, Journal of strategic information systems, Journal of the association for information systems, Knowledge-based systems, Management science, MIS Quarterly.\nIntroduction\nElectronic commerce (e-commerce) can be defined as activities or services related to buying and selling products or services over the internet (Holsapple & Singh, 2000;Kalakota & Whinston, 1997). Firms increasingly indulge in e-commerce because of customers\' rising demand for online services and its ability to create a competitive advantage (Gielens & Steenkamp, 2019;Hamad et al., 2018;Tan et al., 2019). However, firms struggle with this e-business practice due to its integration with rapidly evolving, easily adopted, and highly affordable information technology (IT). This forces firms to constantly adapt their business models to changing customer needs (Gielens & Steenkamp, 2019;Klaus & Changchit, 2019;Tan et al., 2007). Artificial intelligence (AI) is the latest of such technologies. It is transforming e-commerce through its ability to "correctly interpret external data, to learn from such data, and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation" (Kaplan & Haenlein, 2019. p. 15). Depending on the context, AI could be a system, a tool, a technique, or an algorithm (Akter et al., 2021;Bawack et al., 2021;Benbya et al., 2021). It creates opportunities for firms to gain a competitive advantage by using big data to uniquely meet their customers\' needs through personalised services (Deng et al., 2019;Kumar, Rajan, et al., 2019;Kumar, Venugopal, et al., 2019).\nAI in e-commerce can be defined as using AI techniques, systems, tools, or algorithms to support activities related to buying and selling products or services over the internet.\nResearch on AI in e-commerce has been going on for the past three decades. About 4000 academic research articles have been published on the topic across multiple disciplines, both at the consumer (de Bellis & Venkataramani Johar, 2020;Sohn & Kwon, 2020) and organisational levels (Campbell et al., 2020;Kietzmann et al., 2018;Vanneschi et al., 2018). However, knowledge on the topic has not been synthesised despite its rapid growth and dispersion. This lack of synthesis makes it difficult for researchers to determine how much the extant literature covers concepts of interest or addresses relevant research gaps. Synthesising research on AI in e-commerce is an essential condition for advancing knowledge by providing the background needed to describe, understand, or explain phenomena, to develop/test new theories, and to develop teaching orientations in this research area (Cram et al., 2020;Paré et al., 2015). Thus, this study aims to synthesise research on AI in e-commerce and propose directions for future research in the IS discipline. The innovative approach of combining bibliometric analysis with an extensive literature review is used to answer two specific research questions: (i) what is the current state of research on AI in e-commerce? (ii) what research should be done next on AI in e-commence in general, and within information systems (IS) research in particular?\nThis study\'s findings show that AI in e-commerce primarily focuses on recommender systems and the main research themes are sentiment analysis, optimisation, trust, and personalisation. This study makes timely contributions to ongoing debates on the connections between business strategy and the use of AI technologies (Borges et al., 2020;Dwivedi et al., 2019Dwivedi et al., , 2020. It also contributes to research on how firms can address challenges regarding the use of AI-related benefits and opportunities for new product or service developments and productivity improvements (Makridakis, 2017). Furthermore, no study currently synthesises AI in e-commerce research despite its rapid evolution in the last decade triggered by big data, advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms, and cloud computing. Using well-established e-commerce classification frameworks (Ngai & Wat, 2002;Wareham et al., 2005), this study classifies information systems (IS) literature on AI in e-commerce. These classifications make it easier for researchers and managers to identify relevant literature based on the topic area, research style, and research theme. A future research agenda is proposed based on the gaps revealed during the classification to guide researchers on making meaningful contributions to AI knowledge in e-commerce.\nResearch method\nBibliometric analysis\nBibliometric analysis has been increasingly used in academic research in general and in IS research to evaluate the quality, impact, and influence of authors, journals, and institutions in a specific research area (Hassan & Loebbecke, 2017;Lowry et al., 2004Lowry et al., , 2013. It has also been used extensively to understand AI research on specific fields or topics (Hinojo-Lucena et al., 2019;Tran et al., 2019;. In this study, a bibliometric analysis was conducted to understand research on AI in e-commerce using the approach Aria and Cuccurullo (2017) proposed. This methodology involves three main phases: data collection, data analysis, and data visualisation & reporting. The data collection phase involves querying, selecting, and exporting data from selected databases. This study\'s data sample was obtained by querying the Web of Science (WoS) core databases for publications from 1975 to 2020. This database was chosen over others like Google Scholar or Scopus because WoS provides better quality bibliometric information due to its lower rate of duplicate records (Aria et al., 2020) and greater coverage of highimpact journals (Aghaei Chadegani et al., 2013). The following search string was used to query the title, keywords, and abstracts of all documents in the WoS collection:\n(\'\'Electronic Commerce\'\' OR \'\'Electronic business\'\' OR \'\'Internet Commerce\'\' OR "e-business" OR "ebusiness" OR "e-commerce" OR "ecommerce" OR "online shopping" OR "online purchase" OR "internet shopping" OR "e-purchase" OR "online store" OR "electronic shopping"). AND ("Artificial intelligence" OR "Artificial neural network" OR "case-based reasoning" OR "cognitive computing" OR "cognitive science" OR "computer vision" OR "data mining" OR "data science" OR "deep learning" OR "expert system" OR "fuzzy linguistic modelling" OR "fuzzy logic" OR "genetic algorithm" OR "image recognition" OR "k-means" OR "knowledge-based system" OR "logic programming" OR "machine learning" OR "machine vision" OR "natural language processing" OR "neural network" OR "pattern recognition" OR "recommendation system" OR "recommender system" OR "semantic network" OR "speech recognition" OR "support vector machine" OR "SVM" OR "text mining").\nThis search string led to 4414 documents that made up the initial dataset of this study. For quality reasons, only document types tagged as articles, reviews, and proceeding papers were selected for this study because they are most likely to have undergone a rigorous peer-review process before publication (Milian et al., 2019). Thus, editorial material, letters, news items, meeting abstracts, and retracted publications were removed from the dataset, leaving 4335 documents that made up the final datase'] market_size=0 growth_potential=0.0 key_characteristics=[]

How can we improve it? \nUltimate Guide to Google Search Operators and Parameters\nAdvanced search operators can be entered directly into the Google search box to refine your search. Search parameters can be used to construct your own search strings by typing them into the address bar, also called the Chrome omnibar.\nA search operator might look like: \nallintitle: tesla vs edison\n \nA search parameter might look like:\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q="nikola+tesla"\n \nWhat are Google search operators?\nGoogle search operators are special characters and commands sometimes called “advanced operators” or search parameters that extend the capabilities of regular text searches. Search operators can be useful for everything from content research to technical SEO audits.\nHow do I use search operators?\nYou can enter search operators directly into the Google search box, just as you would a text search:\n \nExcept in special cases (such as the “in” operator), Google will return standard organic results.\nGoogle search operators cheat sheet\nYou can find all of the major organic search operators below, broken up into three categories: “Basic”, “Advanced”, and “Unreliable”. Basic search operators are operators that modify standard text searches.\n   I. Basic search operators     " "   "nikola tesla"  Put any phrase in quotes to force Google to use exact-match. On single words, prevents synonyms.   OR   tesla OR edison  Google search defaults to logical AND between terms. Specify "OR" for a logical OR (ALL-CAPS).   |   tesla | edison  The pipe (|) operator is identical to "OR". Useful if your Caps-lock is broken :)   ( )   (tesla OR edison) alternating current  Use parentheses to group operators and control the order in which they execute.   -   tesla -motors  Put minus (-) in front of any term (including operators) to exclude that term from the results.   *   tesla "rock * roll"  An asterisk (*) acts as a wild-card and will match on any word.   #..#   tesla announcement 2015..2017  Use (..) with numbers on either side to match on any integer in that range of numbers.   $   tesla deposit $1000  Search prices with the dollar sign ($). You can combine ($) and (.) for exact prices, like $19.99.   €   €9,99 lunch deals  Search prices with the Euro sign (€). Most other currency signs don\'t seem to be honored by Google.    in   250 kph in mph  Use "in" to convert between two equivalent units. This returns a special, Knowledge Card style result.   \nAdvanced search operators are special commands that modify searches and may require additional parameters (such as a domain name). Advanced operators are typically used to narrow searches and drill deeper into results.\n   II. Advanced search operators     intitle:   intitle:"tesla vs edison"  Search only in the page\'s title for a word or phrase. Use exact-match (quotes) for phrases.   allintitle:   allintitle: tesla vs edison  Search the page title for every individual term following "allintitle:". Same as multiple intitle:\'s.   inurl:   tesla announcements inurl:2016  Look for a word or phrase (in quotes) in the document URL. Can combine with other terms.   allinurl:   allinurl: amazon field-keywords nikon  Search the URL for every individual term following "allinurl:". Same as multiple inurl:\'s.   intext:   intext:"orbi vs eero vs google wifi"  Search for a word or phrase (in quotes), but only in the body/document text.   allintext:   allintext: orbi eero google wifi  Search the body text for every individual term following "allintext:". Same as multiple intexts:\'s.   filetype:   "tesla announcements" filetype:pdf  Match only a specific file type. Some examples include PDF, DOC, XLS, PPT, and TXT.   related:   related:nytimes.com  Return sites that are related to a target domain. Only works for larger domains.   AROUND(X)   tesla AROUND(3) edison  Returns results where the two terms/phrases are within (X) words of each other.   \nUnreliable operators have either been found to produce inconsistent results or have been deprecated altogether. The "link:" operator was officially deprecated in early 2017. It appears that "inanchor:" operators are still in use, but return very narrow and sometimes unreliable results. Use link-based operators only for initial research.\n   III. Unreliable/deprecated operators     ~   ~cars  Include synonyms. Seems to be unreliable, and synonym inclusion is default now.   +   +cars  Force exact-match on a single phrase. Deprecated with the launch of Google+.   daterange:   tesla announcements daterange:2457663-2457754  Return results in the specified range. Can be inconsistent. Requires Julian dates.   link:   link:nytimes.com  Find pages that link to the target domain. This operator was deprecated in early 2017.   inanchor:   inanchor:"tesla announcements"  Find pages linked to with the specified anchor text/phrase. Data is heavily sampled.   allinanchor:   allinanchor: tesla announcements  Find pages with all individual terms after "inanchor:" in the inbound anchor text.   \nNote that, for all of the "allin...:" operators, Google will try to apply the operator to every term following it. Combining "allin...:" operators with any other operators will almost never produce the desired results.\nSearch operator tips &amp; tricks\nHaving all of the pieces is only the first step in building a puzzle. The real power of search operators comes from combining them.\n1. Chain together operator combos\nYou can chain together almost any combination of text searches, basic operators, and advanced operators:\n"nikola tesla" intitle:"top 5..10 facts" -site:youtube.com inurl:2015\nThis search returns any pages that mention "Nikola Tesla" (exact-match), have the phrase "Top (X) facts" in the title, where X ranges from 5 to 10, are not on YouTube.com, and have "2015" somewhere in the URL.\n2. Hunt down plagiarized content\nTrying to find out if your content is unique or if someone is plagiarizing you? Use a unique phrase from your text, put it in quotes (exact-match) after an "intext:" operator, and exclude your own site with "-site:"...\nintext:"they were frolicking in our entrails" -site:moz.com\nSimilarly, you can use "intitle:" with a long, exact-match phrase to find duplicate copies of your content.\n3. Audit your HTTP-&gt;HTTPS transition\nSwitching a site from HTTP to HTTPS can be challenging. Double-check your progress by seeing how many of each type of page Google has indexed. Use the "site:" operator on your root domain and then exclude HTTPS pages with "-inurl:"...\nsite:moz.com -inurl:https\nThis will help you track down any stragglers or find pages that might not have been re-crawled by Google.\nThese are just a few examples of a nearly infinite set of combinations.

You\'ll see it if you look at the address bar, or Chrome omnibar.\nq=query+goes+here\nThe query string. Words are separated by + signs.\nEverything from here on in is preceded by an &amp; sign, as it\'s tagged on to the end. Here\'s where things get interesting...\n 1. Exact match query \nas_epq=query+goes+here\nResults must include the query, in the word order displayed.\n Shows as "query goes here" \n    2. Advanced "Or" filter  \nas_oq="query+string"+goes+here\nResults must include one or more of the words in this string. \nBasically, it\'s like a more advanced version of the one above, using an "or" filter. Thus, every result must have the main initial query, and one or more of the sets of terms in these strings.\n Shows as "query string" OR goes OR here     3. Negative Keywords  \nas_eq=don\'t+include+these+words\nResults must NOT include any words in this string.\n Shows as -don\'t -include -these -words \n 4. Limit the number of results  \nnum=xx\nControls the number of results shown. \nMust be a numeric value, and can be anything up to 100. Doesn\'t work with fractions.\n 5. Filetype match \nas_filetype=extension\nOnly returns results that end in .extension. Currently supports any input. Try it - make a file with a random extension, get it indexed and do a search. Also shows that as long as it validates to something.\n Shows as filetype:extension \n 6. Limit results to one site  \nas_sitesearch=example.com\nLimits results to just the site you choose.\n Shows as site:example.com \n 7. Find results from specific dates   \nas_qdr=x\nSwap out x for the following to limit the search to only files first indexed in:\n d - the previous 24 hours w - the previous seven days m - the previous month y - past year mn - the previous n number of months. So m2 would be the previous two, m3 would be three, and so on. Does work into double digits \n 8. Find pages with specific usage rights \nas_rights=xxx\nLimits the search to files/pages that have certain rights. The options are:\n (cc_publicdomain|cc_attribute|cc_sharealike|cc_noncommercial|cc_nonderived) - free to use or share (cc_publicdomain|cc_attribute|cc_sharealike|cc_nonderived).-(cc_noncommercial) - free to use or share, including commercially (cc_publicdomain|cc_attribute|cc_sharealike|cc_noncommercial).-(cc_nonderived) - free to use, share, or modify (cc_publicdomain|cc_attribute|cc_sharealike).-(cc_noncommercial|cc_nonderived) - free to use, share, or modify commercially \nIf you want to make up your own, put the bits you want in brackets, separated by pipe characters (|), and exclude the bits you don\'t by putting them in brackets, preceded by .- and again pipe-separated.\n 9. Do an allintitle search as a query string \nallintitle%3Asearch+terms\nThis is actually appended to the q= parameter, hence a search for fishing with the allintitle term "sea bass" would require the following query:\nq=fishing+allintitle%3Asea+bass\n Shows as allintitle:search terms \nN.B. This also works with allintext to search page body text, allinurl for searching the URL, and allinanchor for finding sites that are linked to with certain anchor text.   \n 10. Find products in a specific price range \nnnn..yyyy\nLike the allin parameters, this is actually appended to the q= parameter. What this does though is let you search for results between numeric ranges. For example, if you wanted to find documents with numbers between 15 and 100, you\'d put in 15..100. Very useful for finding products in a price range, when combined with the site limiter. Works with $, £, and other such things.\n Shows as query 15..100 \n 11. Do + searches as a query string  \n%2Bterm\nAgain, this is appended to the q= parameter. The %2B is actually the + sign encoded, and will return results featuring only the term used, with no pluralisations, alternate tenses, or synonyms.\n Shows as +term \n        12. Find results for your search term, and synonyms    \n~term\nAnother one that\'s appended to the q= parameter. Returns results for the term used and synonyms.\n Shows as ~term \n      13. Find definitions for your search term    \ndefine%3Aword\nYet another q= parameter add-on. Returns definitions for the word you put in.\n Shows as define:word \n 14. Find results for two words that can have other words in between  \nterm * term two\nAnd another q= parameter add-on. Returns results with listings that contain both words, with other words between them.\n 15. Use Google\'s calculator via query string \nn+n2, n-n2, n/n2, n*n2, n^n2 and n% of n2\nGoogle\'s calculator functions. They are, in order, add, subtract, divide, multiply, raise to the power of, and return x percentage of.\n 16. Modify safe search \nsafe=active\nSets safe search to on. To turn it off, change active to images.\n 17. Find similar sites \nas_rq=example.com\nFinds sites Google thinks are related to the URL you put in.\n Shows as query related:example.com \n   18. View a site\'s backlinks  \nas_lq=example.com\nFinds sites that link to the URL you put in.\n Shows as query link:example.com \n 19. Open a new window  \nnewwindow=n\nOpens clicked listings in a new window. Very useful for opening lots of documents at a time, for competitor research. Set to 1 to activate, and 0 to turn it off.\n 20  . Modify personalized search  \npws\nControls whether personalised search is on or not. Set to 1 to activate, and 0 to turn it off.\n 21 . Stop Adwords from collecting data \nadtest=on\nTurns off AdWords database connection, so your browsing won\'t show up as an impression, and will disable the URLs. Set to on to activate, and off to turn it off.\n 22 . Simulate a button click \nbtnG=Search\nSimulates a click on the normal Google results buttom. Change to btnI to get the I\'m Feeling Lucky button result.\n 23 . Change input encoding settings \nie=\nControls the input encoding settings. This defaults to UTF-8, and is worked out server-side, hence changing it doesn\'t do anything.\n 24 . Change output encoding settings \noe=\nControls the output encoding settings. Works in the same way as ie, so you can tinker away, but it won\'t do anything.\n 25 . Change language \n&amp;hl=value\nChanges the interface language. I won\'t list them all here, but you can find them all here. \n 26 . Limit languages \nlr=value\nLimits the languages used to return results. Not hugely effective.

Running a simple Google search can leave you with an overwhelming number of results. Google search operators, or characters you can add to your search word or phrase, help you find more refined and targeted results. By focusing on certain keywords and excluding others, they allow you to use Google more accurately and effectively. In this article, we list some basic and advanced Google Search operators with tips on how to use them.  Related: The Complete Guide To Researching a Company  What are Google search operators? Google Search operators are combinations of words and symbols that improve your online search results. By focusing on certain keywords and excluding others, they allow you to use Google more accurately and effectively. Search operators can include:    Words such as AND or OR   Punctuation such as quotation marks   Symbols such as @ or $   Any combination of these   Professionals who are responsible for search engine optimization (SEO) in their jobs use these commands frequently and likely know many advanced search operators.  12 Basic search operators These 12 basic search operators are the ones people use most frequently, particularly when doing research. " " Surround your search term with quotation marks to get an exact match of that word or phrase.Example: "B2B marketing jobs" *The asterisk, known as a wildcard, searches for any word or phrase you include.Example: terriers * labradors OR Place OR (all caps) between two words to combine searches. Use it to search for results that have one of those words but not both.Example: B2B OR B2C AND Place AND (all caps) between two words if you want your results to include both.Example: B2B AND B2C | The pipe symbol does the same thing as OR.Example: B2B | B2C ( ) Put a search term between parenthesis to group commands.Example: (B2B OR B2C) marketing jobs - Put a hyphen before any term you want to exclude from results.Example: dog breeds -terriers .. If you want to search for a number between a range of numbers, place two periods between that range. Example: election results 1996..2016 $ Use a dollar sign to search for prices. You can use the Euro sign to search for prices in that currency. Example: piano $1500 @ Use this symbol to search for results in social media.Example: @twitter # Use this symbol to search for hashtags.Example: #sundayfunday in Put "in" between two units you want to convert.Example: 100 F in C Related: How To Use Google Alerts During Your Job Search  15 advanced search operators Advanced search operators are commands that usually need additional information (such as a website or a related term) to work. They help filter search results more than basic operators. They include: site: Search within a certain website or web domain.Example: site:indeed.com or site:.edu related: Find websites with content similar to a certain website.Example: related:indeed.com cache: Find Google\'s most recent cached (saved) version of a webpage.Example: cache:indeed.com filetype: Search for only one type of file.Example: filetype:PDF define: Find the definition of a word.Example: define:neuroscience weather: Find the weather for a location by city, state, county or ZIP code.Example: weather:77354 stocks: Get information about a stock, including its price and recent trends.Example: stocks:TSLA map: See a map of a location.Example: map:houston AROUND(X) Search for terms within a certain number of words of each other.Example: marketing AROUND(5) B2B intext: Search for words within a webpage\'s body text.Example: intext:B2B allintext: Search a page for every term after the command. Add "all" before any of the following search operators (allinurl, allintitle, allinposttitle, allinanchor) to search for all terms.Example: allintext:B2B marketing jobs inurl: Find a URL with a certain word or phrase.Example: dog breeds inurl:terrier intitle: Search a page title for a word or phrase.Example: intitle:backsplash inposttitle: Search for a term within a blog post title.Example: inposttitle:DIY backsplash inanchor: Search for sites linked with specific anchor text.Example: inanchor:backsplash Related: Guide: What Is SEO?  Seven deprecated Google Search operators Deprecated Google Search operators are unreliable or give inconsistent results. If you use them in a Google Search, they might not work. They include: ~ Include synonyms of a word in your search.Example: ~marketing + Find the exact match of a word or phrase.Example: +dog breeds daterange: Search within a certain date range in the Julian date format. Example: marketing jobs daterange:20120-20140 info: Find information about a webpage.Example: info:indeed.com link: Find pages that link to a site.Example: link:indeed.com loc: Find results from a certain place.Example: loc:houston marketing jobs phonebook: Find a phone number.Example: phonebook:kai jones Tips for using Google Search operators Google Search operators can be valuable research tools when you understand how they work. Here are six tips for using them effectively: Remove spaces between commands and search terms. A clean search will likely give you the best results. Combine search operators. You can use nearly all basic and advanced commands together to narrow your search further.Example: "marketing jobs" site:indeed.com inurl:B2B Exclude terms that are not valuable to your search. Use a hyphen frequently to avoid content that is not helpful.Example: "marketing jobs" -houston -freelance Find plagiarism. Find out if someone has copied your content by searching for a phrase and excluding your site.Example: intext:"SEO is the process of attracting organic traffic to your website" -site:indeed.com Learn how Google categorizes your site. Use the related: command to find competing sites and how they rank on search results. Find pages on your website that are not secure. Website URLs that start with HTTPS are secure, while URLs that start with HTTP aren\'t secure. Search your site for unsecured pages using this command: site:indeed.com -inurl:https. How to use Google Search operators You can use Google Search operators to find information the same way you would search for any topic or keyword:   Think of a topic you want to research.   Decide if you want to narrow your search by excluding certain results or looking for information from one particular website.   Find a search operator to perform your specific search. 4. Enter your search term and search operator into the Google Search box.   Press enter. Google then returns a list of filtered results based on your search term and search operator. \nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n  In computer science, phrase searching allows users to retrieve content from information systems (such as documents from file storage systems, records from databases, and web pages on the internet) that contains a specific order and combination of words defined by the user. [1] \n Phrase search is one of many search operators that are standard in search engine technology, along with Boolean operators (AND, OR, and NOT), truncation and wildcard operators (commonly represented by the asterisk symbol), field code operators (which look for specific words in defined fields, such as the Author field in a periodical database), and proximity operators (which look for defined words that appear close to one another, if not directly next to each other as in a phrase search). [2]   [3]  Search operators are used to refine a search when a simple keyword search provides too many unwanted results. [4] \n Although the exact functionality of each search engine is determined by its developers, phrase searching is normally accomplished by wrapping the desired phrase in quotation marks. [5]  For example, a search for red apple may return records that contain the word "apple," ones that contain "red," and ones that contain both words no matter where in the record they appear (that is, assuming the search engine applies Boolean OR logic to its keyword search function), whereas a search for "red apple" will only return records that contain the phrase "red apple."\n Phrase search is one of the more important techniques associated with optimizing the textual content of web pages in such a way that it is likely to be found by someone searching for a certain string of text.\n References  [  edit  ]  \n \n   ^    Beal, Vangie (12 April 2007).

With Search Generative Experience (SGE), you can get AI-powered overviews that bring together the most helpful and relevant information available for your search. Already, generative AI in Search is allowing us to serve a wider range of information needs, including those that benefit from multiple perspectives. With SGE, we’re showing more links, and links to a wider range of sources on the results page, creating new opportunities for content to be discovered. As we’ve continually improved the experience, we’ve also expanded internationally beyond the United States with recent launches in India and Japan. So far, the vast majority of feedback in all three countries has been positive, and people are finding generative AI particularly useful for complex questions they wouldn’t typically think to search. Now, in our largest global expansion yet, we’re bringing generative AI in Search to more than 120 new countries and territories, along with support for four new languages. And we’re introducing a few upgrades, launching first in the U.S., that will make SGE more interactive as you search – including easier follow-ups, AI-powered translation help, and more definitions for topics like coding. Launching in more than 120 new countries and territories, plus four new languages Starting today, we’re bringing Search Labs and SGE in English to more than 120 new countries and territories around the world, including Mexico, Brazil, South Korea, Indonesia, Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa. As part of this expansion, we’re also enabling four new languages for everyone using SGE: Spanish, Portuguese, Korean and Indonesian. So if, for example, you’re a Spanish speaker in the U.S., you can now use generative AI in Search with your preferred language. \n  Search Labs is a new way for you to test early-stage experiments on Search, available on the Google app (Android and iOS) and on Chrome desktop. Once you’re enrolled in Search Labs, just enable the SGE experiment to get started. In new countries, access via Chrome desktop is available today, and access through the Google app will be enabled over the coming week. Testing an easier way to ask follow-up questions We’ve learned from testing generative AI in Search that people appreciate the ability to ask follow-up questions, because it’s a more natural way to seek information or dig deeper on a topic. Now, we’re experimenting with a new way for you to ask follow-up questions directly from the search results page. As you continue to explore a topic, you can easily see your prior questions and search results, including Search ads in dedicated ad slots throughout the page. \n Maybe you searched for “how to run with my beagle” and now you want to ask “how about hiking.” Just tap to enter your question and let your curiosity lead the way. This update will start to roll out over the coming weeks, starting first in English in the United States, and we will continue to iterate on this experience. Adding more context to your translations Sometimes, translating from one language to another involves a bit of guesswork. For instance, in many languages, a single word can have multiple meanings that standard translation tools won’t necessarily detect. Let’s say you want to translate “is there a tie?” from English to Spanish. It seems straightforward, but it’s possible that the word tie could refer to either a piece of clothing or a contest with no winner. Fortunately, generative AI in Search can help you avoid that kind of ambiguity. Soon, if you ask Search to translate a phrase where certain words could have more than one possible meaning, you’ll see those terms underlined. Tap any of those words and you can indicate the specific meaning that reflects what you want to say. This option may also appear when you need to specify the gender for a particular word. \n This AI-powered translation capability is coming soon to the United States for English-to-Spanish translations, and we plan to cover more countries and languages in the near future. Showing definitions for coding and health information In August, we added a new, interactive way to see definitions for educational topics — like science, economics, or history — on AI-powered overviews. Now, we’re extending this functionality to more areas, including coding and health information. On relevant searches, you’ll see certain words highlighted, so you can hover over them to preview their definition or view related images. This update is rolling out over the next month, in English in the United States, with more countries and languages expected to follow soon. \nMastering Google Search Operators: A Comprehensive Guide to Efficient Searching\nIn the vast landscape of the internet, Google stands as a titan of information retrieval. With billions of web pages indexed, Google\'s search engine has become the indispensable tool for finding answers to virtually any question. Yet, with such a vast repository of data, pinpointing the exact information you seek can often feel like searching for a needle in a haystack. Enter Google Search Operators - specialized commands and characters that allow users to refine and narrow down their search queries with precision. By harnessing the power of these operators, users can quickly sift through search results, exclude certain terms, specify domains, and much more. Let\'s delve into the world of Google Search Operators and uncover how they can elevate your searching prowess.\nBasic Operators\n1. Quotation Marks (" ")\nPlacing a phrase within quotation marks tells Google to search for that exact phrase. For example, searching for "machine learning" will return results with that specific phrase.\n Example: "machine learning"\n2. Minus Sign (-)\nUse the minus sign to exclude certain words from your search. For instance, searching for "python programming -snake" will give results about Python programming while excluding results about snakes.\n Example: python programming -snake\n3. Site (site:)\nTo search within a specific website or domain, use the "site:" operator. For example, "site:wikipedia.org artificial intelligence" will only show results from Wikipedia related to artificial intelligence.\n Example: site:wikipedia.org artificial intelligence\n4. OR Operator (OR)\nWhen you want to search for pages that might have one of several words, use the OR operator (in uppercase). For instance, "cats OR dogs" will return results about either cats or dogs.\n Example: cats OR dogs\n5. Asterisk (*)\nThe asterisk serves as a placeholder for any unknown or wildcard terms. It\'s helpful when you\'re trying to find a phrase but are unsure about certain words. For example, "best * for college students" will return results like "best laptops for college students" or "best apps for college students."\n Example: best * for college students\nAdvanced Operators\n6. File Type (filetype:)\nIf you\'re searching for a specific type of file, such as PDFs or Word documents, use the "filetype:" operator. For example, "filetype:pdf annual report" will only show PDF files related to annual reports.\n Example: filetype:pdf annual report\n7. Related (related:)\nUse the "related:" operator to find websites related to a specified domain. For instance, "related:nytimes.com" will show websites Google considers similar to The New York Times.\n Example: related:nytimes.com\n8. Intitle (intitle:) and Allintitle (allintitle:)\n"Intitle:" searches for words in the title of the webpage. For example, "intitle:best hiking trails" will return pages with "best hiking trails" in their titles. "Allintitle:" requires all terms to appear in the title.\n Example: intitle:best hiking trails\n9. Inurl (inurl:) and Allinurl (allinurl:)\nSimilar to "intitle," "inurl:" searches for terms within the URL. For instance, "inurl:technology news" will return pages with "technology" in the URL. "Allinurl:" requires all terms to appear in the URL.\n Example: inurl:technology news\n10. Define (define:)\nThe "define:" operator provides definitions of the word or phrase following it. For example, "define:serendipity" will return the definition of the word.\n Example: define:serendipity\n11. Cache (cache:)\nThe "cache:" operator displays Google\'s cached version of a webpage, showing the version Google has stored.\n Example: cache:example.com\n12. Stocks (stocks:)\nFor quick stock market information, the "stocks:" operator followed by a ticker symbol shows the latest stock data.\n Example: stocks:googl\n13. Movie (movie:)\nGet information about a movie by using the "movie:" operator followed by the movie title.\n Example: movie:inception\n14. Weather (weather:)\nFor a quick weather forecast, use the "weather:" operator followed by a location.\n Example: weather:London\n15. Calculator (calculator:)\nYou can use Google as a calculator by typing a mathematical expression after "calculator:".\n Example: calculator:5+5\nCombining Operators\nTo further refine your search, you can combine operators. For instance, "site:wikipedia.org filetype:pdf" will show PDF files from Wikipedia.\nExamples of Advanced Searches:\nFinding Academic Papers: "site:edu machine learning filetype:pdf"\nExploring Government Reports: "site:gov climate change"\nSearching Within a Range of Numbers: "best smartphones $200..$500"\nSearching Social Media Posts: "site:twitter.com #ArtificialIntelligence"\nConclusion\nGoogle Search Operators are the keys to unlocking the full potential of Google\'s search engine. By mastering these operators, you can save time, find specific information swiftly, and discover hidden gems on the web. Whether you\'re a student, researcher, or curious explorer of the internet, these tools empower you to navigate the digital realm with precision and efficiency. Next time you embark on a quest for knowledge, remember to wield these operators, and watch as Google becomes an even more powerful ally in your quest for information. \n31 Aug, 2023\n[[read-time]] min read\n People across India have diverse needs when it comes to seeking out information, and we have always focussed on innovations that make the Search experience more natural and intuitive. In December last year, we showed how we’re using AI innovations in India for Search that focus on bilingual users’ needs, new search capabilities with your camera, and a new speech recognition model for Hinglish users. In fact, more people use Google Lens in India every month than in any other country worldwide, and the percentage of Indians using voice queries daily is nearly twice the global average. Now, with new breakthroughs in generative AI, we’re again reimagining what a search engine can do. With this powerful new technology, we can unlock new types of questions you never thought Search could answer, and transform the way information is organized, to help you sort through and make sense of what’s out there. In May at Google I/O, we shared our first steps in this new era of Search and introduced Search Labs, a new way to access early experiments in Search, including generative AI capabilities (Search Generative Experience, or SGE for short). Today, we’re excited to announce that we’re rolling out SGE as an experiment in Search Labs in India in English and Hindi. Over the next few months, our goal is to get feedback and iterate on the experience alongside our users.  Improving Search with generative AI  With new generative AI capabilities in Search, we’re now taking more of the work out of searching, so you’ll be able to understand a topic faster, uncover new viewpoints and insights, and get things done more easily. Especially for new internet users, who may often get overwhelmed with the amount of information online, finding an answer more quickly can help ease their journey of discovery. Let’s take a question like “Which is a good beginner trek in Himachal and how to prepare for it?” Normally, you might break this one question down into smaller ones, sort through the vast information available, and start to piece things together yourself. With generative AI, Search can do some of that heavy lifting for you. You’ll see an AI-powered overview of key information to consider, with links to dig deeper. Below this snapshot, you’ll see suggested next steps where you can simply tap a query like “How to take great photos on a trek?”, or you can ask a specific follow-up question. This conversational mode helps you explore a topic more intuitively. Context will be carried over from question-to-question, to help you more naturally continue your exploration. You’ll also find helpful jumping-off points to web content and a range of perspectives that you can dig into. \n With generative AI in Search, relevant queries will now have an AI-powered overview showing key information, with links to explore more. \n This AI-powered Search experience will also be available in Hindi \n  India-focussed features in the Search Generative Experience  We have also introduced features that are unique to SGE in India: switch from an English result to Hindi by tapping the language toggle button, listen to the response with Text-To-Speech by tapping the ‘Listen’ button, and — rolling out soon — you’ll be able to tap the microphone icon in conversational mode to ask follow-up questions instead of typing them. We’ve built these features in the Search generative experience to make it more intuitive and easy for people to access the information they need while searching. \n Switch from an English result to Hindi by simply tapping the toggle button on the search results page \n Tap the microphone icon in conversational mode to ask follow-up questions instead of typing them \n  Featuring a wide range of voices and sources  We know that people want to hear insights from others to help inform their decisions, so we’ve designed these new experiences to highlight and drive attention to content on the web, making it easy for people to dive deeper on the topic they’re learning about. In the query on the Himachal trek, for example, a concise snapshot is valuable for getting started on the topic, while a diverse set of web recommendations is an easier way to dive into a variety of content from across the web. As we bring generative AI into Search, we’re committed to continue sending valuable traffic to sites across the web. We also believe that ads are a vital piece of how the web works, and help people find relevant products and services. In this new generative experience, Search ads will continue to appear in dedicated ad slots throughout the page. And we’ll continue to uphold our commitment to ads transparency and making sure ads are distinguishable from organic search results. When Search ads do appear, they will continue to feature our industry-leading clear and transparent ad labels with the “Sponsored” label in bold black text. \n Search ads will continue to be a native part of this experience, and will appear in dedicated ad slots throughout the page – similar to how they show up today \n  Get help with your coding queries  Whether you’re a new or experienced programmer, learning more about coding is probably on your running to-do list, and generative AI can be a helpful tool. Now you can use Search to more easily understand and debug generated code. SGE currently provides AI-generated overviews to help with tasks across a number of programming languages and tools. For example, you can find answers to how-to questions, and see suggested code snippets for common tasks. Segments of code in overviews are even color-coded with syntax highlighting, so it’s faster and easier to identify elements like keywords, comments and strings, helping you better digest the code you see at a glance. \n SGE can be used to easily understand and debug code, with color-coded syntax highlighting that makes it easier for programmers to review. \n  Taking a responsible approach  There are known limitations with generative AI and LLMs, and Search, even today, will not always get it right. We’re taking a responsible and deliberate approach to bringing new generative AI capabilities to Search. We’ve trained these models to uphold Search’s high bar for quality, and we will continue to make improvements over time. They rely on our hallmark systems that we’ve fine-tuned for decades, and we’ve also applied additional guardrails, like limiting the types of queries where these capabilities will appear. To evaluate the information for yourself, you can also expand your view to see how the response is corroborated, and click to go deeper.  Step into the Lab and experiment, starting today  We’re bringing SGE as an experiment in Search Labs. If you’d like to opt in to try it out and share feedback directly with the teams working on it, just tap the Labs icon in the Google app or Chrome desktop, and visit labs.google.com/search to learn more. The SGE experiment will be available to opted-in users on Chrome desktop today, and is rolling out to the Google App on Android and iOS from today over the coming week. \nPage Contents [hide]\n 1 Google Advanced Search \n 2 What is Advanced Search? \n 3 Some Advanced Google Search Tips\n 3.1 1.

The keyword match types dictate how closely the keyword needs to match with the user’s search query so that the ad can be considered for the auction. For example, you could use broad match to serve your ad on a wider variety of user searches or you could use exact match to hone in on specific user searches.\n Tip \nBroader match types capture all the queries of narrower match types, plus more. This means that a phrase match keyword will match all the searches as the same keyword in an exact match. Similarly, a broad match keyword will match all the searches of equivalent phrase and exact match keywords, plus additional related searches. Therefore, you get the same benefits of multiple match types in one broad match type without needing to repeat keywords.\nKeyword match types\n \n  Broad match  \nAds may show on searches that are related to your keyword, which can include searches that don’t contain the direct meaning of your keywords. This helps you attract more visitors to your website, spend less time building keyword lists, and focus your spending on keywords that work. Broad match is the default match type that all your keywords are assigned because it is the most comprehensive. That means you don\'t have to specify another match type (like exact match, phrase match, or a negative match type).\nThe syntax for broad match is to simply input the keyword. Below is an example of how broad match works:\n \nTo deliver relevant matches, this match type may also take into account the following:\nThe user’s recent search activities\nThe content of the landing page\nOther keywords in an ad group to better understand keyword intent\n Note: It’s critical to use Smart Bidding with broad match. This is because every search query is different, and bids for each query should reflect the unique contextual signals present at auction-time. Smart Bidding uses these signals to ensure that, for all of the relevant searches you could reach with broad match, you’re only competing in the right auctions, at the right bid, for the right user. Learn more about how to grow your Smart Bidding campaigns with broad match \nTips\nAdding very similar keywords, such as “red car” and “car red” isn’t recommended, as only one keyword would match both searches. However, doing so won’t affect your costs or performance in any way. For example, the broad match keywords “red car” and “car red” will be recognized as duplicates and the one with the higher Ad Rank will be used. Even though all your similar keywords may be eligible to serve on the same search, you\'ll have only one bid in the ad auction. Learn more About similar keywords in a Google Ads account \nCheck out the Search Automation technical guide to learn more about the signals Google uses, how queries match to keywords, how automation makes keyword matching more effective, and what you can do to improve performance.\n  Phrase match  \nAds may show on searches that include the meaning of your keyword. The meaning of the keyword can be implied, and user searches can be a more specific form of the meaning. With phrase match, you can reach more searches than with exact match and fewer searches than with broad match, only showing your ads on the searches that include your product or service.\nThe syntax for phrase match is to put quotes around your keyword, such as “tennis shoes”. Below is an example of how phrase match works:\n \n  Exact match  \nAds may show on searches that have the same meaning or same intent as the keyword. Of the 3 keyword matching options, exact match gives you the most control over who views your ad, but reaches fewer searches than both phrase and broad match.\nThe syntax for exact match is to use square brackets, such as [red shoe]. Below is an example of how exact match works:\n \nTip \nUse Smart Bidding with all match types to automatically optimize for your performance objectives. Smart Bidding works best with broad match because the wide set of searches allows it to learn what works best for you. Learn more About Smart Bidding  \nNegative keywords\nYou can use negative keywords to exclude your ads from showing on searches with that term. For example, if you’re a hat company that doesn’t sell baseball hats, you could add a negative keyword for baseball hats.\nHow Performance Max works with Search campaigns and keywords\nPerformance Max complements existing Search campaigns and respects your keyword targeting. If the user’s search query is identical to an eligible Search keyword of any match type in your account, the Search campaign will be prioritized over Performance Max. If the query isn’t identical to an eligible Search keyword (including the spell-corrected search term), the campaign or ad with the highest Ad Rank, which considers creative relevance and performance, will be selected. Learn more About Performance Max campaigns \nAt times, you may find existing keywords showing in Performance Max instead of Search campaign due to ineligibility factors. Here are a few reasons why a Search keyword isn’t eligible to trigger an ad:\nAll campaign or ad group targeting isn’t met.\nAll creatives or landing pages for the ad group are disapproved.\nIt has low search volume status.\nThe campaign is limited by budget.\nRelated Links\n Your guide to Broad Match \n Your guide to Search ads automation \n How to steer Search ads automation \n Search Automation technical guide \n  Was this helpful?

This burgeoning field revolves around the strategic crafting of inputs designed to steer AI models toward generating specific, desired outputs. \nVarious media outlets have been talking about prompt engineering with much fanfare, making it seem like it’s the ideal job — you don’t need to learn how to code, nor do you have to be knowledgeable about ML concepts like deep learning, datasets, etc. You’d agree that it seems too good to be true, right? \nThe answer is both yes and no, actually. We’ll explain exactly why in today’s article, as we trace the beginnings of prompt engineering, why it’s important, and most importantly, why it’s not the life-changing career that will move millions up on the social ladder. \nThe Rise of Prompt Engineering\n \nWe’ve all seen the numbers—the global AI market will be worth $1.6 trillion by 2030, OpenAI is offering $900k salaries, and that’s without even mentioning the billions, if not trillions of words churned out by GPT-4, Claude and various other LLMs. Of course, data scientists, ML experts, and other high-level pros in the field are at the forefront. \nHowever, 2022 changed everything, as GPT-3 became ubiquitous the moment it became publicly available. Suddenly, the average Joe realized the importance of prompts and the notion of GIGO—garbage in, garbage out. If you write a sloppy prompt without any details, the LLM will have free reign over the output. It was simple at first, but users soon realized the model’s true capabilities. \nHowever, people soon began experimenting with more complex workflows and longer prompts, further emphasizing the value of weaving words skillfully. Custom instructions only widened the possibilities, and only accelerated the rise of the prompt engineer—a professional who can use logic, reasoning, and knowledge of an LLM’s behavior to produce the output he desires at a whim. \nSpeaking the Language of the Machines?\n \nAt the zenith of its potential, prompt engineering has catalyzed notable advances in natural language processing (NLP). AI models from the vanilla GPT-3.5, all the way to niche iterations of Meta’s LLaMa, when fed with meticulously crafted prompts, have showcased an uncanny ability to adapt to a vast spectrum of tasks with remarkable agility.\nAdvocates of prompt engineering herald it as a conduit for innovation in AI, envisioning a future where human-AI interactions are seamlessly facilitated through the meticulous art of prompt crafting.\nYet, it’s precisely the promise of prompt engineering that has stoked the flames of controversy. Its capacity to deliver complex, nuanced, and even creative outputs from AI systems has not gone unnoticed. Visionaries within the field perceive prompt engineering as the key to unlocking the untapped potentials of AI, transforming it from a tool of computation to a partner in creation.\nScrutiny of Prompt Engineering\n \nAmidst the crescendo of enthusiasm, voices of skepticism resonate. Detractors of prompt engineering point to its inherent limitations, arguing that it amounts to little more than a sophisticated manipulation of AI systems that lack fundamental understanding. \nThey contend that prompt engineering is a mere façade, a clever orchestration of inputs that belies the AI\'s inherent incapacity to comprehend or reason. Likewise, it can also be said that the following arguments support their position:\nAI models come and go. For instance, something worked in GPT-3 was already patched in GPT-3.5, and a practical impossibility in GPT-4. Wouldn’t that make prompt engineers just connoisseurs of particular versions of LLMs?\n Even the best prompt engineers aren’t really ‘engineers’ per se. For instance, an SEO expert can use GPT plugins or even a locally-run LLM to find backlink opportunities, or a software engineer might know how to use Copilot during to write, test and deploy code. But at the end of the day, they’re just that—single tasks that, in most cases, rely on previous expertise in a niche.\n Other than the occasional prompt engineering opening in Silicon Valley, there’s barely even slight awareness about prompt engineering, let alone anything else. Companies are slowly and cautiously adopting LLMs, which is the case with every innovation. But we all know that doesn’t stop the hype train.\n \nThe Hype Around Prompt Engineering\n \nThe allure of prompt engineering has not been immune to the forces of hype and hyperbole. Media narratives have oscillated between extolling its virtues and decrying its vices, often amplifying successes while downplaying its limitations. This dichotomy has sown confusion and inflated expectations, leading people to believe it’s either magic or completely worthless, and nothing in between.\nHistorical parallels with other tech fads also serve as a sobering reminder of the transient nature of technological trends. Technologies that once promised to revolutionize the world, from the metaverse to foldable phones, have often seen their luster fade as reality failed to meet the lofty expectations set by early hype. This pattern of inflated enthusiasm followed by disillusionment casts a shadow of doubt over the long-term viability of prompt engineering.\nThe Reality Behind the Hype\n \nPeeling back the layers of hype reveals a more nuanced reality. Technical and ethical challenges abound, from the scalability of prompt engineering in diverse applications to concerns about reproducibility and standardization. When placed alongside traditional and well-established AI careers, such as those related to data science, prompt engineering\'s sheen begins to dull, revealing a tool that, while powerful, is not without significant limitations.\nThat’s why prompt engineering if a fad—the notion that anyone can just converse with ChatGPT on a daily basis and land a job in the mid-six figures is nothing but a myth. Sure, a couple of overly enthusiastic Silicon Valley startups might be looking for a prompt engineer, but it’s not a viable career. At least not yet. \nAt the same time, prompt engineering as a concept will remain relevant, and certainly grow in importance. The skill of writing a good prompt, using your tokens efficiently, and knowing how to trigger certain outputs will be useful far beyond data science, LLMs, and AI as a whole. \nWe’ve already seen how ChatGPT altered the way people learn, work, communicate and even organize their life, so the skill of prompting will only be more relevant. In reality, who isn’t excited about automating the boring stuff with a reliable AI assistant? \nPrompt Engineering and Its Future: Will it Move Beyond Being Just a Fad?\n \nNavigating the complex landscape of prompt engineering requires a balanced approach, one that acknowledges its potential while remaining grounded in the realities of its limitations. In addition, we must be aware of the double entendre that prompt engineering is: \nThe act of prompting LLMs to do one’s bidding, with as little effort or steps as possible\n A career revolving around the act described above\n \nSo, in the future, as input windows increase and LLMs become more adept at creating much more than simple wireframes and robotic-sounding social media copy, prompt engineering will become an essential skill. Think of it as the equivalent of knowing how to use Word nowadays.\nConclusion\n \nIn sum, prompt engineering stands at a crossroads, its destiny shaped by a confluence of hype, hope, and hard reality. Whether it will solidify its place as a mainstay in the AI landscape or recede into the annals of tech fads remains to be seen. What is certain, however, is that its journey, controversial by all means, won’t be over anytime soon, for better of for worse. \n         Nahla Davies   is a software developer and tech writer.

It\'s touted as "AI\'s Hottest Job," promising six-figure salaries without the need for programming experience. Enthusiasts describe it as a job of the future, where anyone can earn up to $335K by smooth-talking a cool know-it-all robot into giving right answers. No surprise, Instagram money making sages, YouTube career preachers, and self-proclaimed oracles of TikTok have been very vocal about it. While this sounds like a dream job, is it truly achievable? Let\'s delve into the reality of job market behind the hype to find out.\nAnalyzing job advertisement data provides valuable insights into labor demand trends, responsibilities, qualifications, and salary expectations. Thus, I decided to take a look at the ad data of the so-called “AI’s Hottest Job” with no speculations or presumptions. I collected 73 recently posted unique job ads data from popular on-line job posting platforms. Read about my data collection methodology and access the data set here. While 73 may not be an ideal sample size, it\'s a comprehensive starting point for our analysis. The initial revelation is sobering: there\'s a scarcity of employers seeking "prompt engineers."\nNow, let’s take a look at the data. The most frequently mentioned job title is "prompt engineer." However, other titles such as "IT Innovation Analyst," "Freelance ML/AI Engineer," "Data Scientist," and "AI Engineer" also emerge. I created word clouds for qualifications and responsibilities mentioned in the job descriptions. I don’t think word clouds are meant to reveal extraordinary insights, but they can represent a compact version of the important highlights in the text. As you see, in the job ads employers are talking about experience in computer science, model development, python, prompt design, machine learning, large language models, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence more than other stuff.\nNext, I used ChatGPT and Claude to summarize the collected ads text corpus to identify top prompt engineering qualifications and qualifications. I did multiple rounds of prompting with different approaches followed by manually checking the data to make sure I got stable and valid output.\nEssential qualifications demanded for Prompt Engineer job:\n Proficiency in Python programming (2-5 years of experience) including experience with AI/machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras.\n  Working knowledge of NLP and LLMs (2-5 years of experience) like BERT, GPT-3/4, T5, etc. Knowledge of how these models work and how to fine-tune them.\n  Strong analytical and problem-solving skills. The ability to think critically, design effective prompts, analyze model performance, and troubleshoot issues is vital.\n  Expertise in prompt engineering principles and techniques like chain of thought, in-context learning, tree of thought, etc. This allows guiding the models to desired outcomes.\n  Excellent communication skills, both verbal and written. This is needed for collaborating across teams, explaining technical concepts, and documenting work.\n \nAnd the essential responsibilities of the prompt engineering jobs are:\n Prompt Design and Optimization: Designing, developing, testing, and refining AI-generated text prompts to maximize effectiveness for various applications. This includes utilizing techniques like transfer learning and leveraging linguistic expertise to craft high-quality and diverse prompts.\n  Integration and Deployment: Ensuring seamless integration of optimized prompts into the overall product or system. Collaborating with engineers to implement prompts and models into production environments.\n  Performance Evaluation and Improvement: Rigorously evaluating prompt performance using metrics and user feedback. Conducting continuous testing and analysis to identify areas for optimization and prompt iteration.\n  Collaboration and Requirements Gathering: Working closely with cross-functional teams like data scientists, content creators, and product managers to understand requirements and ensure prompts align with business goals and user needs.\n  Knowledge Sharing: Documenting prompt engineering processes and outcomes. Educating teams on prompt best practices. Keeping updated on the latest AI advancements to bring innovative\n \nIt is fair to say that “no programming experience” premise of the so called “AI’s Hottest Job” is far from the reality, since the top demanded skills in the prompt engineering market are programming proficiency and NLP and LLMs experience. And they are not talking about micky mouse programming skills, they are looking for experts who are familiar with ML and AI frameworks. The employers are not just requiring “familiarity” with LLMs and coding, but, on average, they seek experts with 2-5 years of experience working with structured and unstructured data, coding, NLP, ML, and AI.\nReading the top responsibilities make it more clear why this job title demands such a high level of programming and LLMs skills. Prompt engineering, as a professional job, is not sitting behind a computer and playing with Generative AI models to give you the right answer. It is about building business information systems that optimize inputs, integrate them seamlessly with other information systems and products, and deliver values to users and customers. In other words, businesses are not looking for someone who can chat with ChatGPT, they want to hire experts who can optimize GPT-like models and integrate them with their own products.\nJob ads data analysis of degree requirements indicates a preference for technical educational backgrounds in computer science, math, analytics, engineering, physics, or linguistics. A bachelor’s degree in computer science or a related field is commonly required, with more advanced degrees preferred or required for senior roles. The salaries are very different depending on the responsibilities and seniority. It can be as low as 30k and as high as half a million dollars per year. On average, the job ads with salary information pay between 90k and 195k a year.\nDespite initial enthusiasm, doubts regarding the viability of prompt engineering as a dream job have surfaced. As Ethan Mollick, the Wharton School professor, wrote in a twitter post last year “prompt engineer is not a job of future” because “AI gets easier” and smarter in interpreting basic prompts. A month ago Coursera published a well-thought career guide for prompt engineering (also see this). It seems the initial Gen AI fad is slowly fading, and we are in a better position to understand AI’s current status and future trends. Don’t get me wrong. The quality of Gen AI outputs strongly depends on the inputs. Learning how to use and interact with these complex models is becoming an important skill for almost everyone. There are increasing number of scientific studies that suggest a systematic approach to prompting can significantly improve the outcome of these models (see 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). However, “prompt engineering” is not (and it never was) a dream job that some people wanted it to be. Without significant experience in programming, natural language processing, machine learning, product development, and software integration no one is going to pay you a six-figure salary for just smooth-talking ChatGPT into a right answer.\nThe present and future of prompt engineering, and Gen AI applications, seem to be influenced by two important trends: first, as Ethan Mollick mentioned, Gen AI models are getting more adept at generating good outputs from unsophisticated simple prompt, perhaps similar to how Internet search engines have become better at returning more relevant results from simple search queries. Second, Gen AI models are being increasingly integrated into the business’s products, services, and platforms. This adaptation is crucial for the success of the AI economy. Therefore, knowing how to optimize, fine-tune, customize, and integrate Gen AI models with the current information systems and products is and will rem \nWritten by Coursera Staff •  Updated on May 7, 2024     Explore the job landscape for prompt engineering, including companies hiring, salaries you can earn, the steps to applying for a prompt engineer job, and the future of this career field.

Day-in-and-day-out!\nCredit: Mashable Composite; Getty/Hasan As Ari, ChatGPT\n \nWe examine how AI is changing the future of work — and how, in many ways, that future is already here.\nIt\'s the fantasy of Stable Diffusion image addicts, ChatGPT tinkerers, and everyone else who can\'t get enough of the new crop of AI content generation toys — I mean tools: to get rich just by playing around with AI. "Ladies and gentleman it is happening: \'Prompt engineer\' is now a job title, and it pays between 175k to 300k a year." So claims TikTok user @startingname in a calm but definitive tone in his March TikTok post. To qualify for the job, he says, one just has to "spend time in the algorithm." In other words, it\'s a six-figure job for people who enjoy tinkering with generative AI.  The New York Times called prompt engineering "a skill that those who play around with ChatGPT long enough can add to their résumés." The Washington Post called it "Tech\'s hottest new job." Sinem Buber, lead economist at ZipRecruiter, told CNN that thanks to prompt engineering, "there will be more jobs created because of ChatGPT." Is this pure hype? Not exactly. There are real companies seeking prompt engineers and offering generous pay packages. Most notable among these is Anthropic, home of the large language model Claude, which is famously hiring a prompt engineer, and offering the eye-popping six-figure sums @startingname referred to in his TikTok video. But if you\'re coming down with a case of prompt engineering fever, take a sip of water, breathe, and know that most prompt engineer jobs aren\'t really all that lucrative, and the ones that are might not exist for very long. So before you throw your application to medical school in the shredder in favor of your dream job making hilarious Pope pictures with Midjourney, here\'s what our deep dive into prompt engineer jobs turned up. \nWhat is a prompt engineer, and why are these jobs so exciting? Victor Sanh, a researcher at the AI company Huggingface, which performs studies and builds applications related to AI, was one of the first scholarly researchers to approach prompt engineering, and he broke it down for Mashable:  "Systems such as ChatGPT, GPT-4, Claude, and others that have undergone Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) tend to be more resilient to the formulation of prompts [and] instructions," he said, meaning these systems basically understand what they\'re told in plain language — that\'s the whole point. But, Sanh went on, "they frequently make mistakes, either failing to comprehend the query correctly or failing to recognize that the query is underspecified, making it impossible to provide a proper response." That\'s where prompt engineering comes in.\nAccording to Sanh, another technique exists called chain-of-thoughts prompting, in which a query must be broken down into sub-queries. Sanh called this "prompt engineering on steroids." If you\'re attracted to the idea of being a prompt engineer, this might sound wearyingly technical. And there\'s no more attractive topic in tech right now than generative AI. Starting about five years ago it felt like all the tech news oxygen was getting sucked away by a big shiny object called crypto, which average people found inscrutable and dreary. But ever since OpenAI released ChatGPT late last year, there\'s been a whole new shiny object in tech, and this one is much easier for people — including kids — to understand and get excited about. If you consider ChatGPT an app, it is perhaps the most viral app of all time. \nMashable Light Speed\nSo to one of the hundreds of millions of people who love playing with generative AI, the idea of being a prompt engineer as a job, probably sounds a little like being a video game tester as a job — before you find out that being a video game tester can be an underpaid, exhausting, slog, that is.  Unfortunately, if you get one of these jobs — meaning you\'re one of the few people with "prompt engineer" on their résumé lucky enough to do it full time in exchange for actual money — you will most likely spend eight hours per day spotting when a system is, as Sanh put it, "failing to comprehend the query correctly or failing to recognize that the query is underspecified," and devising ways to make a given system produce a "proper response." That may sound like drudgery, or it might sound rewarding, but it\'s the meat of what you\'ll be doing. Someone\'s life may depend on you doing a good job as a prompt engineer. Benjamin Rader, graduate research fellow in the Innovation and Digital Health Accelerator at Boston Children’s Hospital is part of a team that is hiring a prompt engineer. Generative AI can, according to Rader "help a doctor generate notes faster." Boston Children’s Hospital, he explained, needs "someone who can help us refine the asks of the generative AI, so the information we’re spitting out is limited in hallucinations, and specific to each specific task." If you were imagining this would be a matter of making ChatGPT write good knock-knock jokes, think again. "Each of these tasks is going to be really niche," Rader said. Their internal system isn\'t trained on Wikipedia and Reddit, but instead by sensitive notes about diagnoses, patient billing information, and comments between medical professionals about a given patient in an extremely specific context. "We’re an institution that often serves very specialized care," he said. Some prompt engineer jobs appear much less specialized, but also less lucrative It\'s worth noting that in some places, the term "prompt engineer" has a somewhat looser definition than Sanh\'s. One current ad on Upwork, for instance, is looking for, essentially, someone to generate boatloads of articles about cannabis. In the content marketing an SEO worlds, jobs in which people grind out many, many words per day are not new (the writer of the article you\'re reading got his start at such a job), and this job posting seeking someone to use GPT-3 and Jasper to produce "800-1,500 word blog posts on various topics related to Hemp, Cannabis, and CBD," is clearly a hi-tech version of those. This is not, it should go without saying, one of those fabled six-figure jobs in the AI field. What are the qualifications of a good prompt engineer? This career field is too new for any sort of credentialing process to stand in the way of qualified applicants. In fact, Anthropic\'s ad makes it sound like they\'ll consider whichever randos are able to make strong enough cases for themselves. "If you haven’t done much in the way of prompt engineering yet, you can best demonstrate your prompt engineering skills by spending some time experimenting with Claude or GPT3 and showing that you’ve managed to get complex behaviors from a series of well crafted prompts," the ad says. And hey, anyone can do that, as long as they have access to one of the models. But Matt Bell, a member of the technical staff at Anthropic, suggested to Mashable that a background in coding and machine learning — the process by which models are "trained" — is going to be a big help for applicants. "Having coding knowledge becomes useful when creating systematic evaluations of prompts, and helps with prompting for coding tasks," Bell said in an email. Additionally, "having an ML [machine learning] background can be helpful for understanding the overall strengths and weaknesses of these models."  Still, Bell hastened to add that the actual act of prompt engineering doesn\'t involve typing out code, and that Anthropic\'s "best prompter is a philosopher." Indeed, "It takes logic and reasoning to understand how an AI is going to respond," said Boston Children\'s Hospital\'s Benjamin Rader. So brush up on your Aristotle, applicants. Are these jobs going to last well into the future? Sanh, the researcher at Huggingface, believes the role of prompt engineer is temporary, explaining that the fragility of AI systems is a well-known issue that the companies and organizations producing these models are working to mitigate. After all, in the end, you\'re not supposed to interact with a chatbot by typing out a complicated string of stock phrases. You\'re supposed to just converse with it. Sanh compared some prompt engineers working directly with models to "the PR department preparing someone for a media interview." Their role is to guide the system, sort of like an un-polished candidate for elected office, so that it will "behave properly." He pointed to Microsoft\'s Bing as an example. Bing\'s chatbot famously melted down to New York Times columnist Kevin Roose, and then got rolled out to a wider audience in a much more palatable form, minus the meltdowns. That transformation, according to Sanh, probably involved an epic feat of prompt engineering, because it, "likely required a lot of interactions with the system to refine." On the other hand, Rader\'s team at Boston Children\'s Hospital isn\'t training a chatbot, but an automated information processing system for a hospital. "In a healthcare system," he said, "having a trained person interacting with the AI is going to be important for a really long time. That might not be the case for all fields, but certainly the case for a healthcare system." In any case, lucrative new AI jobs exist now. Some of them may not exist in a few years, but thanks to AI, a lot of jobs may not exist in a few years.

AI tools, such as ChatGPT and other generative AI systems, are already changing the way people work, study and search for information.\nBut as with people, finding the most meaningful answer from AI involves asking the right questions. AI is neither psychic nor telepathic. It cannot intuit, meaning it does not know what a user wants until it\'s explicitly stated. In addition, it cannot provide specific details until the user provides precise parameters for the question. An AI system must be coaxed, or prompted, to deliver the desired output. This is achieved by adding actionable details to the question asked by the user.\nAs AI continues to evolve and demonstrate value in human endeavors, there is a growing need for professionals who understand how to prompt (pose questions or actions to) the AI in the most efficient and effective ways possible. This has led to the emergence of AI prompt engineering jobs as a computer science role and even a viable career path.\n  What is prompt engineering?\nIn the broadest sense, prompt engineering is the art of figuring out how to ask the best questions to elicit the most meaningful responses from AI. This typically involves strong language skills to use nouns, verbs and other vocabulary arts to query the AI.\nAlthough any generative AI user will effectively perform some of the tasks required from a prompt engineer by simply asking questions of the AI, the engineer delves into the nuances of language input and observes how the AI output responds. This allows the prompt engineer to help refine development of the large language model (LLM) and look for AI limitations, errors and defects that AI developers can address. Prompt engineers can also work to train the AI by helping it to understand how to interpret and deal with various prompts. Consequently, the role of prompt engineer has been described as a mix of programming, instructing and teaching.\nTo understand the importance of prompts, consider the simple example of a user querying AI about a simple real-world topic such as awards in the entertainment industry. A user asks the following question:\n Prompt engineering often requires specific and clear requests to receive the desired output.\n"Who won the movie award?"\nThis is an ineffective prompt because it\'s far too broad. The AI might respond by returning every winner of every movie-related award for every year where data is available. It would be an unmanageable list that a user would need to manually parse.\nHowever, the user could ask a more specific question, such as the following:\n"What movie won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 2019?"\nThe AI with adequate data and training could effectively respond with a specific answer. In this case, the movie Green Book won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 2019.\nThe prompt engineer must know that the AI\'s answers to questions are correct. If the results are absent, incomplete, unpredictable or unintended, the prompt engineer can train the AI so that it knows the correct answers -- or report issues to the development team for remediation.\nFor the Academy Award example, a prompt engineer might test the AI by asking the following question:\n"What movie won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1917?"\nSince the first Academy Award ceremony was held in 1929, the prompt engineer would pay particular attention to the way in which the AI responds and what explanations it might provide. This is because there is certainly no data to meet the query as the Academy Awards did not exist in 1917.\n  What does a prompt engineer do?\nFrom an employment perspective, prompt engineering is an abstract form of UI engineering. For example, a traditional UI engineer is responsible for ensuring that the UI is intuitively designed, easy to navigate and provides clear responses or behaviors for users. Generative AI poses different UI challenges because users simply ask the AI for what they want. The UI is the prompt mechanism itself for large language models like GPT. The prompt engineer must understand how the AI works, recognize how the AI will respond given specific prompts and ensure that the AI will deliver meaningful output or responses for any input prompt.\nToday\'s prompt engineer serves a cross-disciplinary role that has the following three major components:\nDevelop, test and refine AI prompts\nThe core role of any prompt engineer is direct work with AI platforms to develop new prompts. They test the AI behaviors and outputs resulting from those prompts and work to improve prompts or help to impose AI guardrails to maintain safe or predictable AI output given new or unexpected prompts.\nFor example, a prompt engineer working with a specific AI platform such as healthcare AI might develop prompts to inquire about patient diagnoses and test how the AI responds when input such as patient names or medical terminology is misspelled. Then, they might make recommendations or changes to refine acceptable prompts or AI responses. In many cases, prompt engineers may be involved in ongoing AI training and refinement.\nCollaborate with cross-disciplinary teams\nA prompt engineer is typically part of the development team, but serves more of a consulting and quality control role. The prompt engineer will work with developers on the product team designing and coding the AI platform. They\'ll also be part of the data team, which establishes the data set and trains the AI platform, as well as the business team comprised of project stakeholders.\nA prompt engineer is usually tasked with aligning prompts to company goals and user needs. For the healthcare AI example, a prompt engineer might focus work on physician and other caregiver needs and expectations from AI, such as how medical terms are used and resulting patient data and diagnoses are presented.\nAnalyze and report\nFinally, a prompt engineer must understand analytics. They need to monitor and correlate inputs and outputs and establish meaningful metrics to measure the behaviors and performance of the AI platform. These analytics are useful to developers, data scientists and the business team.\n GIGO (garbage in, garbage out) is one of the oldest axioms of computer science, but never has it been more relevant than in the AI field. For example, a prompt engineer might analyze AI responses to certain prompt sets and alert the data science team to signs of data bias that could require more training or a review of data content. Similarly, AI prompt responses that indicate data gaps or cause unpredictable results might signal the need for a data review and additional training.\n  5 skills needed to become a prompt engineer\nThe skill set needed to qualify for a prompt engineer job is not long, but it can be deceptively broad. This is typical for emerging roles that are still being defined by a rapidly developing industry. Current prompt engineering roles generally ask for a set of skills that include the following five major elements:\n Strong verbal and written communication skills. Unlike many IT roles, prompt engineers must communicate with AI systems through words and phrases. Detailed prompts can be quite complex and involve hundreds, even thousands, of carefully chosen words. In addition, the cross-disciplinary nature of prompt engineering roles makes communication and collaboration critically important.\n Programming proficiency. Although prompt engineering is not exactly programming, it is common for prompt engineers to have some involvement in coding -- whether they participate in development of the AI platform itself, or use the programming skills to automate testing and other functions. This often requires several years of proven experience with well-accepted languages such as Python or its peers. It also helps to have a strong knowledge of APIs, operating systems and CLIs. Precise requirements will depend on the company and the AI platform.\n Prior prompt experience. Given that prompt engineering is a new role, it\'s difficult to pinpoint a minimum level of prior experience, since the traditional three-to-five-year benchmark just doesn\'t apply. Still, most employers will look for prompt engineers with some demonstrated experience in building and testing AI prompts, along with experience working with major models such as GPT and platforms such as ChatGPT.\n AI technology knowledge. Prompt engineers rely on language skills, but they still require a comprehensive understanding of natural language processing, LLMs, machine learning and some amount of AI-generated content development. This is particularly important if the prompt engineer will have any hands-on involvement in coding or other AI platform development responsibilities.\n Data analysis experience. Prompt engineers must understand the data provided to an AI platform, the data used in prompts and the data generated or provided by the AI in response. This requires strong knowledge of data analytics techniques and tools. For example, a potential employer may look for several years of experience analyzing structured and unstructured data sources. This knowledge can be essential when looking for data bias or other undesirable data, and will serve to objectively understand the quality of the AI output.\nIn addition, prompt engineers will require soft skills, such as excellent problem-solving and analytical skills, along with the ability to collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams. Although formal education and certification is not yet widely available, many employers will seek some traditional type of formal education such as a BS in Computer Science, Engineering or another related field.\n  The future of prompt engineering\nThe future of prompt engineering is hard to predict, but it\'s reasonable to expect that prompt engineering will follow a familiar IT industry maturity pattern of diversification, specialization and standardization.\nFor example, practical or commercial AI such as ChatGPT is still in its infancy, and new LLMs are proliferating quickly. GPT-3.5 has only just been supplanted by GPT-4, and Bing AI has appeared from Microsoft. Other models and platforms will inevitably appear and diversify in the coming years. Prompt engineers will work in the near term to understand and master each model.\nSoon, there may be too many models to master, and a few major models will likely dominate. One might expect that prompt engineers may face a period of specialization where the bulk of their experience and expertise rests in just a few of the models likely to appear -- similar to the way that cloud architects might focus on AWS, Google or Azure rather than attempt to master all three.\nIf this familiar industry pattern holds true for AI, models may eventually experience a period of consolidation as the industry pushes for some forms of standardization. Today, this kind of pattern can be seen in cloud initiatives such as OpenStack, where industry leaders begin collaborating and using open source to create more common and interoperable ways of doing things. Other standardization efforts may involve activities such as AI testing strategies and even a stable of third-party test generation tools. Each step along the way will change the role -- and demand -- for prompt engineers. \nAI may be coming for some jobs, but it\'s also creating new employment too. Early studies predicted that the widespread application of AI had the potential to spark mass job losses, with some industries such as law and finance feeling the heat more than others. But despite the doom and gloom, AI is also set to have some positive effects on the job market.  Adverts for AI-related roles, for example, are already increasing across job websites. Karin Kimbrough, chief economist at LinkedIn, told Business Insider that conversations about AI had spiked on the platform over the past year. "Professionals and employers alike are rapidly adopting AI and generative AI across a broad range of industries. The pace of adoption is notable, especially compared to what we\'ve seen in the past with the rise of technologies like cryptocurrency and virtual reality," he said. LinkedIn found there had been substantial increases in terms such as "ChatGPT," "prompt engineering," "prompt crafting," and "generative artificial intelligence" on member profiles globally. LinkedIn said there had been a 60% increase in mentions of generative artificial intelligence and GAI products between January and September this year. \nRelated stories\n The number of companies with a "head of AI" role has also more than tripled in the past five years, growing 13% since December 2022, according to LinkedIn data. Job search engine Adzuna has also seen several new job titles emerge over the past year as generative AI boomed. "Prompt engineers are our hot take as the job for 2024," James Neave, Adzuna\'s head of data science told BI. "This job didn\'t even exist before generative AI came into the spotlight, and now companies are clamoring to hire people skilled in making the most of the new technologies. At the moment, job openings for this role are quite small, but we see that growing as more companies look to unlock generative AI gains," he said. There were seven adverts for prompt engineers in the UK active in October compared to none last year, according to Adzuna data shared with BI. Prompt engineers write questions and prose for AI chatbots to test and improve their answers. Some of these roles have salaries as high as $375,000 – and don\'t always require tech degrees. Analysts at Adzuna also saw an increase in job listings for AI ethics officers, chief AI officers, AI auditors, AI trainers, and machine managers. Machine learning engineers, workers who were notably in short supply even before the AI boom, also saw an average salary increase from October last year. In the US, Neave said Adzuna\'s data showed that more than 7,000 US jobs are now asking for "generative AI" expertise, while ads for almost 59,000 roles were asking for "machine learning" knowledge. Not all of these new roles require workers to have a tech background, either. \nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.  \nA new type of job has become more prominent amid the AI boom, according to Bloomberg: a "prompt engineer." And one job listing puts the salary range from $175,000 to $335,000 — with only "basic" coding skills required. The "prompt engineer" job requires someone to "speak" with a program such as Google\'s Bard or OpenAI\'s ChatGPT and try to convince it to respond in certain ways, such as convincing it not to say embarrassing things or reveal trade secrets about how it operates, per The Washington Post. \nThis job has become relevant with the rise of text-generating bots that have become available to the wider public. The job "is not a science... It\'s \'let\'s poke the bear in different ways and see how it roars back,\'" said Shane Steinert-Threlkeld, an assistant professor at the University of Washington who studies the language technology behind tools like ChatGPT, told the Post.\nIn 2022, ChatGPT burst onto the scene as one of the first widely accessible generative AI text bots. It could write songs and essays; it stirred panic in academia. And it pushed other companies that had been working on the technology (Google, Meta) into action.  Related: \'Things Will Go Wrong.\' Google Releases Its Chatbot Bard With Caution.  It also put photos generated from text prompts into the spotlight, which users can do on programs like Stable Diffusion. Those prompts can go on for a couple of sentences for many images and are highly specific. But the text generators are supposed to be able to respond to what the average person might ask, and, ideally, avoid gaffes. Riley Goodside, a prompt engineer at Scale AI, a machine learning company, told the Post that one of the things he does is when GPT-3 makes an error, he talks to the robot and helps it realize it made a mistake by walking it through its own "reasoning" step-by-step.\nThe work can also involve forcing such systems into making mistakes, which then allow them to be corrected within the system — i.e., figuring out what makes things like ChatGPT begin to emit nonsense. This is also known in the industry as "hallucinating."  Related: We Asked Google\'s AI Bard How To Start A Business. Here\'s What It Said.  One job listing involves talking to a robot for long periods called a "Prompt Engineer and Librarian," from the AI research company Antrhopic. Besides a salary of up to $335,000 and relocation help for moving to the San Francisco area, the role requires only "basic programming skills," such as writing programs with Python.  Klarity, an AI document company, and Boston Children\'s Hospital also have similar AI roles open — both are looking for people to help them figure out how to use AI in their businesses (and both ask for some engineering experience).'] market_size=0 growth_potential=0.0 key_characteristics=[]

After a procession of overhyped technologies like Web3, the metaverse, and blockchain, executives are bracing for the tidal wave of generative AI, a shift some consider to be on par with the advent of the internet or the desktop computer. But with power comes responsibility, and generative AI offers as much risk as reward. The technology is testing legal regimes in copyright and intellectual property, creating new cyber and data governance threats, and setting off automation anxiety in the workforce.        Generative AI deployment: Strategies for smooth scaling   Organizations need to move quickly to keep up with stakeholder expectations, yet they must proceed carefully to ensure they do not fall foul of regulations or ethical standards in areas like data privacy and bias. Operationally, enterprises need to reconfigure their workforce and forge partnerships with tech companies to design safe, effective, and reliable generative AI.   To gauge the thinking of business decision-makers at this crossroads, MIT Technology Review Insights polled 1,000 executives about their current and expected generative AI use cases, implementation barriers, technology strategies, and workforce planning. Combined with insights from an expert interview panel, this poll offers a view into today’s major strategic considerations for generative AI, helping executives reason through the major decisions they are being called upon to make. Key findings from the poll and interviews include the following:  Executives recognize the transformational potential of generative AI, but they are moving cautiously to deploy. Nearly all firms believe generative AI will affect their business, with a mere 4% saying it will not affect them. But at this point, only 9% have fully deployed a generative AI use case in their organization. This figure is as low as 2% in the government sector, while financial services (17%) and IT (28%) are the most likely to have deployed a use case. The biggest hurdle to deployment is understanding generative AI risks, selected as a top-three challenge by 59% of respondents.       Companies will not go it alone: Partnerships with both startups and Big Tech will be critical to smooth scaling. Most executives (75%) plan to work with partners to bring generative AI to their organization at scale, and very few (10%) consider partnering to be a top implementation challenge, suggesting that a strong ecosystem of providers and services is available for collaboration and co-creation. While Big Tech, as developers of generative AI models and purveyors of AI-enabled software, has an ecosystem advantage, startups enjoy advantages in several specialized niches. Executives are somewhat more likely to plan to team up with small AI-focused companies (43%) than large tech firms (32%).   Access to generative AI will be democratized across the economy. Company size has no bearing on a firm’s likelihood to be experimenting with generative AI, our poll found. Small companies (those with annual revenue less than $500 million) were three times more likely than mid-sized firms ($500 million to $1 billion) to have already deployed a generative AI use case (13% versus 4%). In fact, these small companies had deployment and experimentation rates similar to those of the very largest companies (those with revenue greater than $10 billion). Affordable generative AI tools could boost smaller businesses in the same way as cloud computing, which granted companies access to tools and computational resources that would once have required huge financial investments in hardware and technical expertise.       One-quarter of respondents expect generative AI’s primary effect to be a reduction in their workforce. The figure was higher in industrial sectors like energy and utilities (43%), manufacturing (34%), and transport and logistics (31%). It was lowest in IT and telecommunications (7%). Overall, this is a modest figure compared to the more dystopian job replacement scenarios in circulation. Demand for skills is increasing in technical fields that focus on operationalizing AI models and in organizational and management positions tackling thorny topics including ethics and risk. AI is democratizing technical skills across the workforce in ways that could lead to new job opportunities and increased employee satisfaction. But experts caution that, if deployed poorly and without meaningful consultation, generative AI could degrade the qualitative experience of human work.   Regulation looms, but uncertainty is today’s greatest challenge. Generative AI has spurred a flurry of activity as legislators try to get their arms around the risks, but truly impactful regulation will move at the speed of government. In the meantime, many business leaders (40%) consider engaging with regulation or regulatory uncertainty a primary challenge of generative AI adoption. This varies greatly by industry, from a high of 54% in government to a low of 20% in IT and telecommunications.    Download the report.

The findings show that these are still early days for managing gen AI–related risks, with less than half of respondents saying their organizations are mitigating even the risk they consider most relevant: inaccuracy.\nThe organizations that have already embedded AI capabilities have been the first to explore gen AI’s potential, and those seeing the most value from more traditional AI capabilities—a group we call AI high performers—are already outpacing others in their adoption of gen AI tools.\nThe expected business disruption from gen AI is significant, and respondents predict meaningful changes to their workforces. They anticipate workforce cuts in certain areas and large reskilling efforts to address shifting talent needs. Yet while the use of gen AI might spur the adoption of other AI tools, we see few meaningful increases in organizations’ adoption of these technologies. The percent of organizations adopting any AI tools has held steady since 2022, and adoption remains concentrated within a small number of business functions.\nTable of Contents\n It’s early days still, but use of gen AI is already widespread \n Leading companies are already ahead with gen AI \n AI-related talent needs shift, and AI’s workforce effects are expected to be substantial \n With all eyes on gen AI, AI adoption and impact remain steady \n About the research \n1. It’s early days still, but use of gen AI is already widespread\nThe findings from the survey—which was in the field in mid-April 2023—show that, despite gen AI’s nascent public availability, experimentation with the tools is already relatively common, and respondents expect the new capabilities to transform their industries. Gen AI has captured interest across the business population: individuals across regions, industries, and seniority levels are using gen AI for work and outside of work. Seventy-nine percent of all respondents say they’ve had at least some exposure to gen AI, either for work or outside of work, and 22 percent say they are regularly using it in their own work. While reported use is quite similar across seniority levels, it is highest among respondents working in the technology sector and those in North America.\nOrganizations, too, are now commonly using gen AI. One-third of all respondents say their organizations are already regularly using generative AI in at least one function—meaning that 60 percent of organizations with reported AI adoption are using gen AI. What’s more, 40 percent of those reporting AI adoption at their organizations say their companies expect to invest more in AI overall thanks to generative AI, and 28 percent say generative AI use is already on their board’s agenda. The most commonly reported business functions using these newer tools are the same as those in which AI use is most common overall: marketing and sales, product and service development, and service operations, such as customer care and back-office support. This suggests that organizations are pursuing these new tools where the most value is. In our previous research, these three areas, along with software engineering, showed the potential to deliver about 75 percent of the total annual value from generative AI use cases.\n \nIn these early days, expectations for gen AI’s impact are high: three-quarters of all respondents expect gen AI to cause significant or disruptive change in the nature of their industry’s competition in the next three years. Survey respondents working in the technology and financial-services industries are the most likely to expect disruptive change from gen AI. Our previous research shows that, while all industries are indeed likely to see some degree of disruption, the level of impact is likely to vary. Industries relying most heavily on knowledge work are likely to see more disruption—and potentially reap more value. While our estimates suggest that tech companies, unsurprisingly, are poised to see the highest impact from gen AI—adding value equivalent to as much as 9 percent of global industry revenue—knowledge-based industries such as banking (up to 5 percent), pharmaceuticals and medical products (also up to 5 percent), and education (up to 4 percent) could experience significant effects as well. By contrast, manufacturing-based industries, such as aerospace, automotives, and advanced electronics, could experience less disruptive effects. This stands in contrast to the impact of previous technology waves that affected manufacturing the most and is due to gen AI’s strengths in language-based activities, as opposed to those requiring physical labor.\nResponses show many organizations not yet addressing potential risks from gen AI\nAccording to the survey, few companies seem fully prepared for the widespread use of gen AI—or the business risks these tools may bring. Just 21 percent of respondents reporting AI adoption say their organizations have established policies governing employees’ use of gen AI technologies in their work. And when we asked specifically about the risks of adopting gen AI, few respondents say their companies are mitigating the most commonly cited risk with gen AI: inaccuracy. Respondents cite inaccuracy more frequently than both cybersecurity and regulatory compliance, which were the most common risks from AI overall in previous surveys. Just 32 percent say they’re mitigating inaccuracy, a smaller percentage than the 38 percent who say they mitigate cybersecurity risks. Interestingly, this figure is significantly lower than the percentage of respondents who reported mitigating AI-related cybersecurity last year (51 percent). Overall, much as we’ve seen in previous years, most respondents say their organizations are not addressing AI-related risks. \n \n2. Leading companies are already ahead with gen AI\nThe survey results show that AI high performers—that is, organizations where respondents say at least 20 percent of EBIT in 2022 was attributable to AI use—are going all in on artificial intelligence, both with gen AI and more traditional AI capabilities. These organizations that achieve significant value from AI are already using gen AI in more business functions than other organizations do, especially in product and service development and risk and supply chain management. When looking at all AI capabilities—including more traditional machine learning capabilities, robotic process automation, and chatbots—AI high performers also are much more likely than others to use AI in product and service development, for uses such as product-development-cycle optimization, adding new features to existing products, and creating new AI-based products. These organizations also are using AI more often than other organizations in risk modeling and for uses within HR such as performance management and organization design and workforce deployment optimization.\n  AI high performers are much more likely than others to use AI in product and service development.  \nAnother difference from their peers: high performers’ gen AI efforts are less oriented toward cost reduction, which is a top priority at other organizations. Respondents from AI high performers are twice as likely as others to say their organizations’ top objective for gen AI is to create entirely new businesses or sources of revenue—and they’re most likely to cite the increase in the value of existing offerings through new AI-based features.\n \nAs we’ve seen in previous years, these high-performing organizations invest much more than others in AI: respondents from AI high performers are more than five times more likely than others to say they spend more than 20 percent of their digital budgets on AI. They also use AI capabilities more broadly throughout the organization. Respondents from high performers are much more likely than others to say that their organizations have adopted AI in four or more business functions and that they have embedded a higher number of AI capabilities. For example, respondents from high performers more often report embedding knowledge graphs in at least one product or business function process, in addition to gen AI an \nGreatest AI Market ROI is Realized through Integration with IoT and 5G for Improved Solutions     1h Free Analyst Time    Speak directly to the analyst to clarify any post sales queries you may have.   This report evaluates the AI technology and solutions market, including an analysis of leading AI vendors, strategies, solutions and applications. The report assesses the state of AI development, implementation, and operation. The report analyzes the forecasts AI market sizing for by technology type, deployment method, solution type, network and technology integration, and by industry verticals from 2023 through 2028.\nSelect Report Findings:\nTotal global AI solution market will reach $301.2 billion by 2028, growing at 29.4% CAGR\n Global unsupervised machine learning market will reach $15.6 billion by 2028, growing at 25.1% CAGR\n The combination of AI and IoT (AIoT) will drive up to 27% of new AI systems integration, primarily involving IIoT\n AI solutions in a public cloud environment shall be almost three times those of private cloud deployments through 2028\n Key AI technology systems integration opportunities include Expert Systems, Decision Support Systems, Fuzzy Systems, and Multi-Agent Systems\n \nArtificial Intelligence (AI) represents a wide variety of technologies including Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural language processing, and more. We see AI increasingly embedded within many systems and applications including everything from data management to retail shopping.\nThe AI segment is currently very fragmented, characterized by most companies focusing on silo approaches to solutions. Longer-term, the publisher sees many solutions involving multiple AI types as well as integration across other key areas such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and data analytics.\nThere are many potential use cases for AI within the cybersecurity domain. For example, AI may be used in IoT to bolster security, safeguard assets, and reduce fraud. There are varying opinions about security in IoT.\nFor example, some companies favor a distributed(decentralized) approach whereas other companies believe a more centralized approach leveraging strictly centralized cloud architecture makes more sense. We see little possibility in which signature-based security solutions will work with IoT in an edge computing environment for a variety of reasons including the limitation on the throughput of communications between distributed endpoints and centralized cloud.\nAI has various advantages including the fact that it is a more lightweight application (because it does not require all the data that comes with tracking digital signatures/code for known viruses), more effective in identifying malware, easier and less costly to maintain as there is no need to constantly identify new malware code. This is all because AI-based security is looking for malicious behaviors rather than known malicious code.\nLonger-term, AI will move beyond fraud prevention and prevention of malicious acts as AI will be used to feed advanced analytics and decision making. This will be especially true in IoT solutions involving real-time data as AI will be used to make determinations for autonomous actions.\nConsumer-facing apps and services supported by AI are many and varied including chatbots and Virtual Personal Assistants (VPA) in support of customer care and lifestyle enhancement. The automobile industry is another example in which AI is becoming increasingly useful, both in the near term for solutions such as the inclusion of VPAs, and longer-term use cases such as support of self-driving vehicles. Another consumer market area in which AI will be integrated is wearable technology. As wearables become more mainstream and integrate into everyday life with increasing dependency, there will be a need for integration with Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, and Analytics.\nAI is expected to have a big impact on data management. However, the impact goes well beyond data management as we anticipate that these technologies will increasingly become part of every network, device, application, and service. One area important to enterprise will be Intelligent Decision Support Systems (IDSS), which are a form of Expert System that utilize AI to optimize decision making. IDSS will be used in many fields including agriculture, medicine, urban development, and other areas. IDSS will also be used in policy making and strategy at the highest levels of enterprises as well as governmental organizations.
